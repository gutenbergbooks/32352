<p>On Christmas Eve, <span class="smcap">Mr. Punch</span>, on the
strength&#8212;or, rather, length&#8212;of a
Message from <span class="smcap">President Pierce</span>, visited her
Majesty <span class="smcap">Queen Mab</span>. He was
received by a most courteous Dream-in-Waiting, who introduced him
through the Gate of Horn, whence, as <span class="smcap">Colonel
Sibthorp</span> beautifully remarks,</p>

<center>"Veris facilis datur exitus Umbris."</center>

<p>Dream-World was merrily keeping its Yule-tide, with shadowy Sports
and
dissolving Pastimes. As <span class="smcap">Mr. Punch</span> entered,
the Game was</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 20%">
<a href="images/002b.png">
<img src="images/002b.png" width="100%" alt="forfeits" /></a>
</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Lady Britannia</span> was enthroned, Mistress
 of the Revel, and her golden
apron was heaped with Pledges. The owners, a miscellaneous group,
awaited the sentence of penalties.</p>

<p>Down, at a smile-signal from the Lady in the Chair, down went the
broad
brow of <span class="smcap">Mr. Punch</span>, to repose on her knee,
while Kings, and Ministers,
and Hierarchs, and Demagogues came rustling round to listen.</p>

<p>The magic formula was silverly uttered.</p>

<table summary="magic formula">
<tr><td><img src="images/002c.png" width="100%" alt="Here is a Thing, and a Very
Pretty Thing," />
</td>
<td><img src="images/002d.png" width="100%" alt="What shall be Done by the Owner" />
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>"Answer, dear <span class="smcap">Mr. Punch</span>," said the Lady in
 the Chair. "You always say
exactly what I wish said."</p>

<p>"The Owner," said <span class="smcap">Mr. Punch</span>, "will
retire." And the <span class="smcap">Earl of Aberdeen</span>,
who had forfeited Public Confidence, withdrew, and <span class="smcap">Britannia</span>
 murmured
her intense satisfaction with the proceeding.</p>

<p>The next forfeit was called. "The Owner," said the oracle, "will go
down
upon his knees, will, in all abjectness of humiliation, beg pardon of
all the world, and will humbly deposit his purse at the foot of the
Ottoman nearest to him." A heavy tread, and the <span class="smcap">Emperor
 of all the
Russias</span> sullenly stalked away, sooner than thus redeem his
Honour.</p>

<p>The third forfeit. "The Owner will find a Lady, whose well-omened
Christian name is <span class="smcap">Victoria</span>, and to her he
will recite some verses, of
his own making, in praise of Chobham and Spithead." "I am not<span class="pagenum"><a id="pageiii" name="pageiii"></a>[Pg iii]</span> much
of a
poet," said <span class="smcap">Mr. Cobden</span>, "but if my Friend,
<span class="smcap">Bright</span>, will help me, I will
gladly so redeem my Blunder."</p>

<p>The fourth. "A poor Foreigner," whispered the over-kindly Lady, but <span class="smcap">Mr.
Punch</span> sternly buttoned his pockets. "The Owner will behave with
common
honesty until further notice." A gentleman in a Spanish costume looked
surprised at such a desire, and said that he did not care whether he did
or did not redeem his Bonds.</p>

<p>The fifth was called, and a light step approached, and somebody was
heard humming a melody of <span class="smcap">Tom Moore's</span>. "The
Owner," said <span class="smcap">Mr. Punch</span>,
"will carry three times through the chamber something to help you,
Madam, to hear your own voice better." <span class="smcap">Lord John
Russell</span> smiled, and
said that he hoped his Reform Bill would so redeem his Promise.</p>

<p>And the Dream&#8212;it is dream fashion&#8212;grew confused, but <span class="smcap">Mr.
Punch</span> thinks there was a scramble for the rest of the things, and that
everybody snatched what he could. <span class="smcap">Mr. Gladstone</span>, seizing, with
tax-gatherer's gripe, what he thought was a work on Theology, got "The
Whole Duty&#8212;off Paper." <span class="smcap">Emperor Louis Napoleon</span> departed very happy
with a Cradle. <span class="smcap">Lord Palmerston</span> went out, angry with a Scotch Compass,
which though only just out of the Trinity House, had an abominable bias
to N.E. <span class="smcap">Pope Pius</span> ran about most uncomfortably, apprehending the loss of
a French Watch and Guard, to go without which would, His Holiness said,
be his ruin. <span class="smcap">Mr. Disraeli</span> made several vain grabs at a portfolio, which
<span class="smcap">Britannia</span>, laughing good-natured scorn, refused to let him have; and
when the <span class="smcap">Earl of Derby</span> tried for the same thing, she presented him with
a Racing Game, as more suitable to his capabilities. Several Aldermen,
who had presented specimens of Mendacity, received packets of tickets,
inscribed Mendicity, to everybody's delight, and there was a cheer for a
bold Bishop, who had put down a Carriage and was content to take up a
little Gig. Another Bishop&#8212;he had a Fulham cut&#8212;found his
mitre, but some one, in unseemly satire, had surmounted it with a golden
and most vivacious Weathercock.</p>

<p>"And what would <i>you</i> put down, dear <span class="smcap">Mr.
Punch</span>," said the Lady of the
Revel, "if we began again?"</p>

<p>"This, dear Lady," said <span class="smcap">Mr. Punch</span>,
gracefully bending, and proffering an
object at which the eyes of <span class="smcap">Britannia</span>
sparkled like diamonds,
"this&#8212;which&#8212;as your game is over, I will pray you to keep in pledge
that, six months hence, I will present you with its still richer
successor."</p>

<p>And <span class="smcap">Britannia</span>&#8212;the smile at her heart
reflected in her face&#8212;accepted</p>

<h3>POLITICAL SUMMARY.</h3>

<p>The unjust demands of the <span class="smcap">Emperor of Russia</span>
 on the Ottoman Porte, and
his subsequent occupation of the Danubian Principalities, occupied the
earnest attention of the Parliament and the people throughout the year,
and was the occasion of much inquiry and discussion.</p>

<p>We cannot do better than add a summary of <span class="smcap">Lord John Russell</span>'s Speech,
towards the close of the Session, in explanation of the position of
affairs:&#8212;</p>

<p>"When he entered office, he said, his attention was called to the
question of the Holy Places; and he instructed <span class="smcap">Lord Cowley</span>, at Paris, to
give the subject his earnest attention. Soon after he, <span class="smcap">Lord John Russell</span>, learned that a special Russian Minister would be sent to
 the
<span class="smcap">Sultan</span>, to put an end, by some solemn act, to
 the differences that
existed with regard to the Holy Places. He did not object to that; and
<span class="smcap">Prince Menschikoff</span> arrived at Constantinople
on the 2nd of March. From
this point, <span class="smcap">Lord John Russell</span> went over the
subsequent events&#8212;the
resignation of <span class="smcap">Fuad Effendi</span>; the message of <span class="smcap">Colonel Rose</span>
To <span class="smcap">Admiral Dundas</span>, sent at the request of the Grand Vizier, and subsequently
retracted; and the notification by the Turkish Ministers to <span class="smcap">Lord Stratford</span>, in April, that certain propositions had been made to
them to
which they were unwilling to accede. 'I should say,' continued he, 'that
up to this time the Government of <span class="smcap">Her Majesty</span>
 at home, and Her Majesty's
Minister at St. Petersburg, had always understood that the demands to be
made by Russia had reference to the Holy Places; and were all comprised,
in one form or another, in the desire to render certain and permanent
the advantages to which Russia thought herself entitled in favour of
persons professing the Greek religion. <span class="smcap">Lord Stratford</span> understood from
the Turkish Ministers, that it had been much desired by the Russian
Ambassador that the requests which were made on the part of Russia
should be withheld from the knowledge of the representatives of the
other Powers of Europe; and these fresh demands were as new to the
Government of France as they were to the Government of <span class="smcap">Her Majesty</span>.' The
propositions were changed from time to time, until <span class="smcap">Prince  Menschikoff</span>
gave in his ultimatum, and left Constantinople. 'I consider that this
circumstance was one very greatly to be regretted. It has always
appeared to me, that, on the one side and the other, there were
statements that would be admitted, while there were others that might be
the subject of compromise and arrangement. The Russian Minister
maintained that Russia had, by certain treaties (especially by the
treaties of Kainardji and Adrianople) the right to expect that the
Christians in the Turkish territory would be protected; and he declared
at the same time, that Russia did not wish in any manner to injure the
independence or integrity of the Turkish Empire. The Sultan's Ministers,
on their part, maintained that it was their duty, above all things, to
uphold the independence of the Sultan, and to require that nothing
should be acceded to which would be injurious to his dignity or would
derogate from his rights; but at the same time, they declared that it
was the intention of the Sultan to protect his Christian subjects, and
to maintain them in the rights and privileges which they had enjoyed
under the edicts of former Sultans. Such being the statements on the two
sides, I own it appears to me that the withdrawal of the Russian mission
from Constantinople, accompanied as that measure was by the preparation
of a large Russian force, both military and naval, on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagev" name="pagev"></a>[Pg v]</span> frontiers
of
Turkey, was a most unfortunate step, and has naturally caused very great
alarm to Europe, while it has imposed great sacrifices both upon Turkey
and upon the Turkish provinces adjoining Russia.' These appearances
became so serious that the fleet was ordered to approach the
Dardanelles; the French fleet advanced at the same time; and the
Russians entered the Principalities. This, Turkey had an undoubted right
to consider a <i>casus belli</i>; but France and England induced the
Sultan
to forego that right, thinking it desirable to gather up the broken
threads of negotiation, and strive for some arrangement for maintaining
peace. The French Minister for Foreign Affairs&#8212;'a gentleman whose
talents, moderation, and judgment it is impossible too greatly to
admire'&#8212;drew up a note, omitting what was objectionable on both sides.
The Austrian Government, which had previously declined to enter on a
conference, changed its views when the Russians occupied the
Principalities, and <span class="smcap">Count Buol</span> took the
proposal of <span class="smcap">M. Drouyn de Lhuys</span>
as a basis for a note. This note was agreed to by the Four Powers; and
the <span class="smcap">Emperor of Russia</span> had accepted it,
considering that his honour would
be saved, and his objects attained, if that note was signed by the
Turkish Minister.</p>

<p>"Supposing that note 'to be finally agreed upon by Russia and Turkey
as
the communication which shall be made by Turkey, there will still remain
the question of the evacuation of the Principalities. It is quite
evident, Sir, that no settlement can be satisfactory which does not
include or immediately lead to the evacuation of those Principalities.
(<i>Cheers.</i>) According to the declaration which has been made by the
General commanding the Russian Forces, <span class="smcap">Prince
Gortschakoff</span>, the
evacuation ought immediately to follow on the satisfaction obtained by
Turkey from the <span class="smcap">Emperor of Russia</span>. I will
only say further, that it is
an object which Her Majesty's Government consider to be essential: but
with respect to the mode in which the object is to be obtained&#8212;with
respect to the mode in which the end is to be secured&#8212;I ask the
permission of Parliament to say nothing further upon this head, but to
leave the means&#8212;the end being one which is certain to be obtained&#8212;to
leave the means by which it is to be obtained in the Executive
Government. With respect to the question which has been raised as to the
fleets of England and France at Besika Bay, that of course need not be
made any question of difficulty, because, supposing Turkey were in
danger, we ought to have the power at all times of sending our fleets to
the neighbourhood of the Dardanelles to be ready to assist Turkey in
case of any such danger, and we ought not to consent to any arrangement
by which it may be stipulated that the advance of the fleets to the
neighbourhood of the Dardanelles should be considered as equivalent to
an actual invasion of the Turkish territories. But, of course, if the
matter is settled&#8212;if peace is secured, Besika Bay is not a station
which would be of any advantage either to England or France.'</p>

<p>"In conclusion he said, he thought we had now a fair prospect,
without
involving Europe in hostilities, or exposing the independence and
integrity of Turkey, that the object in view would be secured in no very
long space of time. 'I will only say further, that this question of the
maintenance of Turkey is one that must always require the attention&#8212;and
I may say, the vigilant attention&#8212;of any person holding in his hands
the foreign affairs of this country. This, however, can only be secured
by a constant union between England and France&#8212;by a thorough concert
and constant communication between those two great Powers."</p>

<p>In our next Volume we shall have to treat of the results of these
difficulties.</p>

<p>One effect of these "rumours of wars" was the introduction of the
Naval
Coast Volunteers' Bill, a very necessary and important measure for the
establishment of a Naval Militia, and by which 18,000 to 20,000
well-trained seamen are placed at the disposal of the country.</p>

<p>Other bills of considerable importance in themselves, though not of
political interest, became Law, and have been productive of great good
to the community. The Act for the Suppression of Betting Houses has
saved many a thoughtless fool from ruin, and dispersed, though not
destroyed, the bands of brigands who then preyed upon the unwary. The
prisons of London gave abundant and conclusive testimony of the vast
number of persons, especially the young, who had been led into crime by
the temptation held out by Betting Houses.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Fitzroy</span>'s Act for the Better
Prevention and Punishment of Aggravated
Assaults upon Women and Children has done much, though not all that is
required, to lessen the brutality of the lower orders, and the Smoke
Prevention Act has removed in part one of the disgraces of our
metropolis.</p>

<p>The Vaccination Extension Act was a sanitary measure of great
importance, as the mortality from small-pox had long been greater in
England than in any other country in Europe.</p>

<p>On the 16th of December <span class="smcap">Lord Palmerston</span>
resigned his office of Secretary
of State for the Home Department, but he was subsequently induced to
resume his position in the Government.</p>

<p>On the 20th of August the Parliament was prorogued by commission, and a
Parliamentary Session of an unusually protracted and laborious character
brought to an end. The year had been generally very prosperous, but the
scanty harvest, and the unsettled condition of the labouring classes,
who resorted to the desperate and suicidal agency of "strikes" for
bettering their condition, added to the probability of a war with
Russia, brought it to a gloomy close, and it was as much as <i>Punch</i>
could do to sustain the nation in moderate cheerfulness.</p>

<h2>MR. PUNCH IN DUBLIN.</h2>

<p>"Yes, with much pleasure," said <i>Mr. Punch</i>, M.P. for England,
as he
entered the Octagon Hall in Parliament Palace; and, in his usual elegant
and affable manner, extended his white-gloved hand to a courtly
gentleman who had requested his presence.</p>

<p>"I was sure you would say so," said the gentleman, and he raised a
finger. A watchful official at a door instantly turned to the electric
dial, and <i>Mr. Punch's</i> gracious assent was known at Holyhead,
before he
had finished congratulating his companion, in the most truly charming
style, on a promised knighthood, of which the Viceroy of Ireland had
whispered something to <i>Mr. Punch</i>.</p>

<p>"No man ever earned his spurs better than the man who has been
spurring
railways into increased activity for so many years," said <i>Mr. Punch</i>,
with a beautiful bow.</p>

<p>"I have not called you from the House at an unfortunate time, I
trust,
Sir," said the other. "Not that you can ever be spared, but&#8212;"</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">William Gladstone</span> is quite up to his
work," replied the great patriot.
"He has but a couple of dozen of the Brigade in hand at present, and he
is tossing up one after the other, cup-and-ball fashion, cupping or
spiking him to taste, with the precision of a <span class="smcap">Ramo
Samee</span>. I can leave
<span class="smcap">William</span>. Let us go."</p>

<p>"You will take care that no other passenger is put into <i>Mr.
Punch's
coupé</i>, guard," said the gentleman, as the Euston whistle sounded.</p>

<p>"No masculine passenger, please tell him, Mr. <span class="smcap">Roney</span>,"
 said <i>Mr. Punch</i>,
facetiously. "Good night."</p>

<p>"This Irish journey is capitally done, certainly," said <i>Mr. Punch</i>,
 as,
thirteen hours later, he found himself over his coffee and prawns in
Sackville Street, on a radiant morning, and all the bright eyes of
Dublin sparkling round the door of his hotel, eagerly glancing towards
his balcony. <i>Mr. Punch</i> rushed forth, <i>serviette</i> in hand.
His large
heart beat high at the sight of so much loveliness, and at the sound of
those angel-voices, rising into musical cheering.</p>

<p>"Bless you, my darlings!" <i>Mr. Punch</i> could say no more, but
finished
his prawns, and, throwing his manly form upon a jaunting car, he dashed
over the bridge, and to Merrion Square.</p>

<p>"An' it's for luck I'll be takin' your honour's sixpence, and not for
the dirthy money," said the excited driver, as he rattled round the
corner, and into the Square, and the gigantic cylinders of the
<span class="smcap">Exhibition</span> burst upon <i>Mr. Punch's</i>
gaze.</p>

<p>"My Irish friend," said <i>Mr. Punch</i>, gravely, but not severely,
"do not
talk nonsense. Your carriage is clean, your horse is rapid, you are
civil, and your fare is certain. In London, we have as yet neither clean
carriages, rapid horses, civil drivers, nor certain fares. We may learn
those lessons of you. Learn two from us. Do not believe in luck, but
practice perseverance; and do not call that money dirty which is the
well-earned pay of honest service. To sweeten the advice, there is a
shilling." And <i>Mr. Punch</i> entered the Exhibition building, and was
drawing out his purse at the turnstile. But two gigantic policemen, in
soldierly garb, welcomed him with a respectful smile, and the turnstile
suddenly spun him into the building gratis, but a little too fast for
dignity. What a sight was that before him! The vast hall, with its blue
lines and red labels, looked a handsome instalment of Paxtonia. Plashing
fountains, murmuring organs, a <span class="smcap">Marochetti</span>
Queen high pedestalled, white
statues, glistering silver-blazoned banners. A fine and a noble sight,
and worthy of all plaudit; but it was not that which almost bewildered
the great patriot, as he was shot into Dargania. Those eyes again&#8212;two
thousand pairs at least&#8212;Irish diamonds, worth mines of Koh-i-noors,
suddenly flashing and sparkling and melting upon him. That telegraph
message from the Octagon Hall&#8212;and, as they say in the Peers' House,
"and the Ladies summoned." Staggered though he was, you do not often see
such a bow as that with which <i>Mr. Punch</i> did homage to his lovely
hostesses.</p>

<p>Two of the fairest stepped forward gracefully, and blushingly
proffered
themselves as his guides through the building.</p>

<p>"Chiefly, that I may set them in my prayers," murmured <i>Mr. Punch</i>,
 "if
you happen to have names&#8212;&#8212;"</p>

<p>Those blue eyes belong to <span class="smcap">Honora</span>, and
those violet eyes to <span class="smcap">Grace</span>, and
all to <i>Mr. Punch's</i> heart henceforth and until further notice.
They
proceeded, and there was a sound as of a great rustling, as of a world
of feminine garments forming into procession and following, but it was
vain for <i>Mr. Punch</i> to think of looking round, for he never got
further
than the face of one or other of his companions. They paraded the
building.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grace</span> bade him look from her, and observe
the five halls, in the central
and greatest of which they stood. She showed him that Royalty had
contributed a gorgeous temple, rich in gems and gold, richer in an
artist-thought of the Prince who designed it. And, standing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span> on the
platform, she pointed out that the forge and the loom and the chisel had
all been busy for that huge hall, whose area offered a series of bold
general types of the work to be seen in detail around it. And China was
near with her carvings, and India with her embroideries, and Japan with
a hundred crafts (now for the first time revealed, thanks to our
brother, the King of Holland), and Belgium with her graceful ingenuity,
and France with her artistic luxury, and the Zollverein with its
bronzes, and Austria with her maps, and flowers, and furniture. And then
<span class="smcap">Grace</span> led him on to the Fine Arts Hall, where
 the original thoughts of a
thousand painters, new and old, glowed upon him from walls which the
<span class="smcap">Devonshires</span>, and <span class="smcap">Lansdownes</span>,
 and <span class="smcap">Talbots</span>, and <span class="smcap">Portarlingtons</span>,
 and
<span class="smcap">Yarboroughs</span>, and <span class="smcap">Charlemonts</span>,
 and others, had joined to enrich with the
choicest treasures of their castles and mansions. And amid the priceless
display, <i>Mr. Punch</i> felt justly proud of his aristocratic friends,
 who
could at once trust and teach the people.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Honora</span> bade him look from her, and they
passed from an exquisite
Mediæval Court, its blue vault studded with golden stars, crossed the
hall, and observed a long range of machinery doing its various restless
work, and doing it noiselessly, thanks to a silent system and a
tremendous rod, sent from Manchester by <span class="smcap">Fairbairn</span>,
 through whose Tubular
Bridge <i>Mr. Punch</i> had flown at dawn. And <span class="smcap">Honora</span>
 showed him where
Ireland had put forth her own strength, and thrown down her linens and
her woollens in friendly challenge, and with her hardware, her minerals,
her beautiful marbles, and her admirable typography. They ascended, and
passing through long lines of galleries, <i>Mr. Punch's</i> adorable
guides
pointed out, amid a legion of wares, things more graceful and useful
than he had seen assembled since the bell (on that 11th of October last
but one) tolled for the fall of Paxtonia.</p>

<p>"And now, dear <i>Mr. Punch</i>," said <span class="smcap">Honora</span>,
 "you have looked round our
Dublin Exhibition, and&#8212;and&#8212;"</p>

<p>"And," said <span class="smcap">Grace</span>, "you know that you
sometimes say rather severe things
about Ireland&#8212;"</p>

<p>"Never," said <i>Mr. Punch</i>, dropping upon his knees. "Never. But
here I
register a vow."</p>

<p>The whole assembly was suddenly hushed, and had <i>Mr. Punch's</i>
words been
literal, instead of only metaphorical, pearls and diamonds, you might
have heard them fall on those boards.</p>

<p>"That for your sakes here present, and for the sake of all the wise,
and
energetic, and right-hearted men of Ireland who have to do with this
building, and with your roads, and railways, and schools, and the like,
I will henceforth wage even more merciless and exterminating war than
hitherto with the humbug Irish patriots (dupes or tools), who tarnish
the name of a nation which can rear and fill an edifice like this."</p>

<p>A shout which made the good <span class="smcap">Sir John Benson's</span>
 broad arches ring again
and again. And, as it subsided, there came forth from the crowd of
ladies, whose eyes all turned affectionately on the new comer, a
stalwart presence. <i>Mr. Punch</i> sprang up.</p>

<p>"This is your work!" he exclaimed. "Don't say it is not, <span class="smcap"> William Dargan</span>,
because I know it is, and because England knows it too, and holds your
name in honour accordingly."</p>

<p>That day's proceedings are not reported further. But all <i>Mr.
Punch's</i>
friends who wish to please him will have the goodness to run over to
Dublin, and see the finest sight which will be seen between this and the
First of May next.</p>

<h2>A NEW TURN IN THE TEMPERANCE MOVEMENT.</h2>

<p>A real, genuine, out-and-out Teetotaller says he likes this
Table-turning vastly; for, though it keeps folks to the table, still it
keeps them from the bottle. "The table may go round," he says, "but the
wine does not circulate." There may be more in this teetotaller's
chuckle than wine-bibbers imagine. We ourselves have heard an instance
of a wealthy City man, who is nearly as mean as the <span class="smcap">Marquis
 Of
Northminster</span>, who spares his Port regularly, by proposing to his
company, as soon as the cloth is removed, that "they should try a little
of this table-moving that is so much talked about." The decanters are
removed, and he keeps his company with their fingers fixed upon the
mahogany, until Coffee is announced. We warn all persons who are in the
habit of dining out, against lending their hands to this favourite
trick.</p>

<hr />

<h4>"Provided Always."</h4>

<p>Though, perhaps, not strictly within our province to attend to the
Commissariat of any but ourselves, we beg leave to announce that we have
undertaken to supply the whole of the Camp at Chobham with chaff.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="smcap">The Author of Scotch Beer.</span>&#8212;We lately read

<h2>CANVAS TOWNS.</h2>

<p>Our contemporary, <i>Household Words</i>, has given an account of
Canvas Town
in the new world, but we doubt whether a description of one of the
Canvas Towns&#8212;or Towns under Canvas&#8212;in the old world, would not reveal
a greater amount of depravity and corruption than anything that exists
even in Australia. A Canvas Town in England is no less bent on gold
discovery than a Canvas Town at Port Phillip&#8212;the only difference being
that the candidate's pocket, instead of the earth, is the place that the
electors or gold diggers are continually digging into. In the Colonies
the inhabitants of a Canvas Town are huddled together irrespective of
rank, and frequently the best educated persons are found doing the
dirtiest work, just as may be seen in a Canvas Town in England before
election time. The inhabitants of a Colonial Canvas Town think only of
the gold and the quartz, just as at home the inhabitants of a Canvas
Town think of nothing but filthy dross and drink&#8212;the quarts taking of
course precedence of the pints in the estimation of the "independent"
voters.</p>

<hr />

<h4>More Ornamental than Useful.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Disraeli</span> calls "invective a great
ornament in debate." According to
this species of decoration, Billingsgate ought to be the most ornamental
place of debate in the world; and <span class="smcap">Mr. Disraeli</span>
 himself, than whom few
orators deal more largely in invective, deserves taking his rank as the
most ornamental debater that ever was born.</p>

<h2>CIVIL (VERY CIVIL) WAR AT CHOBHAM.</h2>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/009a.png" alt="T" class="cap" width="35%" />

<p class="cap_2">THE gallant fellows now assembled under arms and over
ankles in the mud
and dust of Chobham, were on Tuesday, the 21st of June, led&#8212;or rather
guided&#8212;into one of the most civil wars to be found in the
pages&#8212;including the fly-leaves&#8212;of history.</p>
</div>

<p>It having been understood that a battle was to be fought, every one
seemed animated with the spirit of contention, and the struggle
commenced at the Railway Station, where a company of heavy Cockneys,
several hundred strong, besieged with great energy the few flys,
omnibuses, and other vehicles, that were to be met with. The assault was
vigorously carried; but the retaliation was complete; for the cads,
drivers, and other marauders, having allowed the besiegers to fall into
the snare, drove them off to the field, and exacted heavy tribute as the
price of their ransom. Some few took refuge by trusting to their heels,
rather than undergo the severe charge to which they would have been
exposed; and they arrived, after a fatiguing march of nearly five miles,
much harassed by the ginger-beer picquets and tramps that always lie on
the outskirts of an army.</p>

<p>It was, however, on the field, or rather among the furze-bushes of
Chobham, that the battle was really to be fought; and in the afternoon,
the Guards, the 1st and 2nd Brigades, with the Artillery and Cavalry,
took up a sheltered position under a hill, to conceal themselves from
the enemy. This "concealment" was rather dramatic than real; for the
enemy had already determined not to see, and as none are so blind as
those who won't see, the "concealment" was quite effectual. When the
force had had full time to get itself snugly out of sight, the "foe"
poured down with immense vehemence from Flutter's Hill, and began
squeezing into ditches, or hiding behind mud walls, to avoid the
"observation" of the enemy, who knowing from signals where it was proper
to look without the possibility of seeing anything, kept up the spirit
of this truly "civil" war in the politest manner.</p>

<p>The moment of action was now eagerly looked for on all sides, and
particularly by our old friend the British Public, who had perched
himself on all the available eminences commanding a view of those who
were about to give&#8212;and take&#8212;battle. Aides-de-camp were now seen flying
about in all directions with breathless speed, delivering "property"
despatches, similar to those with which the gallant officers at Astley's
are in the habit of prancing over the platformed planes of Waterloo.
Suddenly the skirmishers of the 42nd made a sally from the heights, and
poured an incessant volley of blank cartridge into the ears of the
Highlanders; who, after one decisive struggle&#8212;though we defy anybody to
say what the gallant fellows really struggled with&#8212;dislodged the foe,
who had on the previous day received regular notice to quit their
lodging at the time agreed on. The Guards now came on from the O. P.
side, Upper Entrance, of the Common, and turning back the wing, made for
an adjoining flat, marching fearlessly over the set pieces under a heavy
fire&#8212;of nothing&#8212;from the muskets of the enemy. Victory seemed
hesitating on which side to declare herself, when a rush of cavalry
turned the scale, scattered the weights, and upset the barrow of a
seller of sweet-stuff, who had incautiously&#8212;as a camp
follower&#8212;ventured too near the flanks of the horse on the field of
battle.</p>

<p>The <i>mélée</i> now became general, and it being impossible to
discriminate
between friend and foe, the Guards, seeing a large assemblage of the
public on Flutter's Hill, were immediately "up and at 'em." This put the
Hill in a more than usual flutter, for the British public having been
given to understand there was "nothing to pay" for their position, were
not prepared to expect there would be any charge whatever, and still
less a charge at the point of the bayonet. It was here that the war
assumed its most civil aspect, for the public, though vigorously
charged, were most civilly requested to get out of the way, and the
request was met on all sides with the most civil compliance. Thus ended
the battle of Chobham of the 21st of June, in which several fell on both
sides; but of all who fell every one happily jumped up again. A few lost
their balance, but as these kept no banker's account the loss did not
signify. We annex a spirited drawing of</p>

<h2>CHARACTER IN A BLUE BAG.</h2>

<p>Two attorneys quarrel about a matter of business; one of them accuses
the other of trickery; the latter retorts on the former by calling him a
liar and a scoundrel: and the first attorney brings an action for
slander against the second. Whereon, according to the report of the
case:&#8212;</p>

<blockquote><p>"The <span class="smcap">Lord Chief Justice</span>, in
summing up, said it was not actionable
to say of a man personally, 'you are a liar,' or 'you are a
scoundrel;' nor was it actionable to combine the epithets, and say,
'you are a lying scoundrel;' but, if said of an attorney in his
professional character, those words would be actionable."</p></blockquote>

<p>What the law&#8212;speaking by the <span class="smcap">Lord Chief Justice</span>&#8212;means
 to say, is, that
abuse, in order to be actionable, must be injurious; that to call an
attorney a lying and scoundrelly man does him no injury; whereas,
calling him a lying and scoundrelly attorney tends to injure him in his
profession. The law, therefore, presumes, that you may esteem a man to
be a true and honest attorney, whilst in every other capacity you
consider him a false and mean rascal; so that you may be willing to
confide the management of your affairs to him, although you will not
trust him with anything else.</p>

<p>It is curious that the rule applied to the defamation of lawyers is
reversed in its application to invective against legislators. Members of
Parliament are censurable if they impute falsehood and scoundrelism to
each other in a personal sense, but not censurable for making those
imputations in a Parliamentary sense. The theory of this anomaly seems
to be, that the affairs of political life cannot be conducted without
deceit and baseness, and accordingly that there is no offence in
accusing an honourable gentleman of evincing those qualities in
labouring at his vocation, that is to say for his country's good, for
which it is necessary that he should cheat and deceive.</p>

<p>The law of slander, partially applied to attorneys, ought perhaps to
be
wholly inapplicable in the case of barristers. If a counsel may suggest
to a jury a supposition which he knows to be false, and particularly
one, which at the same time tends to criminate some innocent person; and
if he is to be allowed to make such a suggestion for his client's
benefit, he is allowed to be base and deceitful for the benefit of his
client. To charge him with deception and villainy in his character of
advocate, is to accuse him of professional zeal; to advantage him, not
injure him, in his business. It ought to be lawful to call him a liar
and a scoundrel in a forensic sense, as well as in every other.</p>

<hr />

<h2>THE HARDEST OF ALL SWEARING.</h2>

<p>When <span class="smcap">Lord Brougham</span>, the other evening, was
 presenting some petition for
the abolition of oaths, there were certain oaths in particular which he
might have taken the opportunity of recommending the Legislature to do
away with. They are alluded to in the following passage from a letter
signed <span class="smcap">Censor</span> in the <i>Times:</i>&#8212;</p>

<blockquote><p>"As a condition of admission, the Head and Fellows of all
 Colleges
are enjoined to take oaths to the inviolable observance of all the
enactments of the statutes. These oaths, to use the words of the
commission, increase in stringency and solemnity, in proportion as
the statutes become more minute and less capable of being observed.
These oaths are not only required but actually taken. Men of high
feeling, refinement, education, and, for the most part, dedicated in
an especial manner to God's service, are called on suddenly to swear
that they will obey enactments incapable of being obeyed."</p></blockquote>

<p>Oaths such as these are enough to make any man turn Quaker&#8212;at least
by
quaking as he swallows them. Any amount of swearing that ever disgraced
a cabstand is preferable to such shocking affidavits; and there is
something much more horrible in the oaths of college Fellows than there
is in the imprecations of such fellows as coster-mongers. Our army once
"swore terribly in Flanders," but never at such a rate as officers of
the Church Militant appear to be in the habit of swearing at the
Universities: and although there is said to be an awful amount of
perjury committed in the County Courts, it is probable that the
individuals forsworn at those halls of justice are far exceeded in
number by the Reverend Divines who kiss the book to untruth at the
temples of learning. It is a strange kind of consistency that objects to
rapping out an oath, and yet obstinately retains such oaths at Oxford
and Cambridge.</p>

<h2>THE GREAT INDIAN FACT.</h2>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/012.png" alt="A" class="cap" width="30%" />

<p class="cap_3">A GREAT fact in India&#8212;nay, why should we not throw
affected modesty on
one side, and say at once, <i>the</i> great fact in that great
country&#8212;is
the position occupied in the most flourishing Indian communities by our
humble&#8212;pooh! why blink the truth&#8212;our noble selves!</p>
</div>
<p>India is a country of contrasts&#8212;of wealth and want, of prosperity and
and decay, of independence and servility, of self-government and
despotism.</p>

<p>The want, the decay, the servility, and the despotism are to be found
among all the native races&#8212;Bengalee and Madrassee, Maratta and Telinga,
Canarese and Tamul, Bheel and Ghoorka, Khoond and Rohilla, Sikh and
Aheer&#8212;it will be seen that <i>we</i> too have been getting up our
India;&#8212;under all sorts of authorities&#8212;Potails and Zemeendars, Kardars
and Jagheerdars, Ameers and Mokaddams, and Deshmucks; with all kinds of
tenures&#8212;Zemeendaree and Ryotwaree and Jagheerdaree. But the wealth, the
prosperity, the independence, and the self-government, are to be met
with in one class of communities, under one form of authorities, among
one kind of holders only. These oases in the desert of Indian native
existence are those in which <i>Punch</i>&#8212;the <i>Punch</i>&#8212;the <i>Mr.
Punch</i>&#8212;in
one word the Indian representative of <span class="smcap">OURSELVES</span>&#8212;bears
 sway!</p>

<p>This remarkable circumstance&#8212;so deeply gratifying to us of course&#8212;is
no imagination of our own brain, no dream of our self-satisfaction, no
figment of any of our numerous flatterers and admirers; but an
historical truth, recorded in his distinctest and dryest manner by one
of the distinctest and dryest writers upon India&#8212;<span class="smcap">Mr.
 Campbell</span>, whose
work has been much bought, much read, and unblushingly cribbed from by
pillars of the state in the House of Commons, and by leading columns of
the morning papers.</p>

<p>Hear then upon this great fact <span class="smcap">Mr. Campbell</span>&#8212;of
 the Bengal Civil
Service&#8212;whose civil service to Punches in general, and Indian Punches
in particular, <i>Punch</i> is glad here to acknowledge. Hear <span class="smcap">
Mr. Campbell</span>,
on the nature and effects of the authority and administration of Punch
in India. Where Punches preside, "the system" he tells us "is infinitely
better than anything we have hitherto seen." The revenue is larger and
more easily collected; the condition of the cultivator more flourishing;
property more secure, and the police better administered. Each village,
under the beneficent and equal rule of its Punch, "is one community,
composed of a number of families, all possessing rights in the soil, and
responsibilities answering to their rights." Still Punch is no tyrant.
"The Democratic Punch has no official power or authority except as
representing this body of proprietors"&#8212;- like ourselves, who have no
authority except in so far as we represent the people of Great Britain,
which we flatter ourselves we do in most things.</p>

<p>"The Punch," <span class="smcap">Mr. Campbell</span> tells us (page
88), "is as a rule of the
plural number"&#8212;(that is, there are several contributors);&#8212;"a clever
well-spoken man, who has a good share of land" (we substitute brains),
"and is at the head of a number of relatives and friends" (in our case,
readers and admirers), "becomes one of the Punch, which office he holds
for life, if he continues to give satisfaction to his constituents" (the
public and proprietors are enough for us); "but if he becomes very old,
or incompetent, or unpopular, some one else, probably, revolutionises
himself into the place" (and serve the old, incompetent, unpopular
contributor right). "The office of <i>Punch</i> is much coveted" (we
should
think it was), "and all arrangements are by the Punch collectively" (if
the gentle reader could be present at one of our Saturday dinners, he
would see what very small beer we think of the Editor). "They act not as
persons having authority over the community, but always as
representatives, and on many subjects they consult their constituencies
before deciding." (When did <i>we</i> not consult public opinion, and
when
did <i>we</i> claim any other authority than as representing the country
 at
large?) "There is generally in the village a leader of opposition,"
(poor creature!) "perhaps the defeated candidate for the last Punchship"
(obviously a rejected contributor), "who leads a strong party" (oh, dear
no! <span class="smcap">Mr. Campbell</span>, you are misinformed on that
 point), "accuses the Punch
of malversation, and, sometimes, not without reason, of embezzlement"
(not on this side the water), "and insists on their being compelled to
render an account of their stewardship" (our proprietors' books are open
to all the world); "for there are abuses and grievances in all
corporations, in all parts of the world" (<i>i.e.</i> "even Punches are
not
perfect"&#8212;a truth, probably, though we trust we shall never exemplify it
in our own case).</p>

<p>Such is the rule of the Punches of India&#8212;and now for its effect. It
produces communities, "strong, independent, and well-organized" (page
90). It is established over what <span class="smcap">Mr. Campbell</span>
 styles "a perfect
democratic community."</p>

<p>In short, this rule of Punch is the only one <span class="smcap">Mr.
Campbell</span> is able to
rest on with entire satisfaction, as the model to which all the other
native organizations of India ought to be, as far as possible,
assimilated.</p>

<p>Yes&#8212;give every community its <i>Punch</i>, and India would be
something like
what it ought to be&#8212;something like what England has become since the
rule of <i>Punch</i> was firmly established here&#8212;something which would
render altogether unnecessary these dreadful Indian debates, and the
immense amount of Indian "cram" which members, journalists, and
conscientious persons, who follow the Parliamentary reports, are obliged
to bolt, and of which we have disgorged a sample, with great relief to
ourselves, at the beginning of this article.</p>

<h2>OUR HONEYMOON.</h2>

<p>THURSDAY, MAY 23, 18&#8212;</p>

<p>"It would be something to say, <span class="smcap">Fred</span>, that
we'd been to France."&#8212;</p>

<p>"To be sure," replied <span class="smcap">Fred</span>. "And yet only
to have something to say and
nothing to show, is but parrot's vanity."</p>

<p>"But that needn't be. We might learn a great deal. And I <i>should</i>
 like
to see Normandy; if only a bit of it. One could fancy the rest, <span class="smcap">Fred</span>.
And then&#8212;I've seen 'em in pictures&#8212;the women wear such odd caps! And
then <span class="smcap">William the Conqueror</span>&#8212;papa says <i>we</i>
 came in with him; so that we
were Normans once; that is on papa's side&#8212;for mamma won't hear that
<i>she</i> had anything to do with it&#8212;though papa has often threatened
to
get his arms. And now I think of it, <span class="smcap">Fred</span>,
what are <i>your</i> arms?"</p>

<p>"Don't <i>you</i> know?" asked <span class="smcap">Fred</span>,
puckering his mouth&#8212;well, like any bud.
"Don't you know?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't;" and I bit my lip and <i>would</i> be serious. "What <i>are</i>
they?"</p>

<p>"It's very odd," said he, "very odd. And <i>you</i> are Normans! To
think
now, <span class="smcap">Lotty</span>, that I should have made you flesh
 of my flesh, without first
learning where that flesh first came from. You must own, my love, it was
very careless of me. A man doesn't even buy a horse without a pedigree."</p>

<p>(I <i>did</i> look at him!)</p>

<p>"Nevertheless"&#8212;and he went on, as if he didn't see me&#8212;"nevertheless,
my beloved, I must say it showed great elevation of mind on your part to
trust your future fate to a man, without so much as even a hint about
his arms. But it only shows the beautiful devotion of woman! What have
arms to do with the heart? Wedlock defies all heraldry."</p>

<p>"I thought"&#8212;said I&#8212;"that, for a lawful marriage, the wedding ring
must
have the Hall mark?"</p>

<p>"I don't think it indispensable. I take it, brass would be as
binding.
Indeed, my love, I think according to the Council of Nice, or Trent, or
Gretna Green&#8212;I forget which&#8212;a marriage has been solemnised with
nothing more than a simple curtain-ring."</p>

<p>"Nonsense," said I; "such a marriage could never hold. Curtain-rings
are
very well in their way; but give me the real gold."</p>

<p>"True, my love, that's the purity of your woman's nature. In such a
covenant we can't be too real. Any way"&#8212;and he took my wedding-finger
between his&#8212;"any way, <span class="smcap">Lotty</span>, yours seems
strong enough to hold, ay,
three husbands."</p>

<p>"One's enough," said I, looking and laughing at him.</p>

<p>"At a time"&#8212;said <span class="smcap">Fred</span>; "but when we're
about buying a ring, it's as
well to have an article that will wear. Bless you," and he pressed his
thumb upon my ring, "this will last <i>me</i> out and <i>another</i>."&#8212;</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Frederick</span>," I cried very angrily; and
then&#8212;I couldn't help it&#8212;I
almost began to weep. Whereupon, in his kind, foolish manner he&#8212;well, I
<i>didn't</i> cry.</p>

<p>"Let us, my darling," said <span class="smcap">Fred</span>, after a
minute, "let us return to our
arms. And you came in with the Normans?"</p>

<p>"With <span class="smcap">William the Conqueror</span>, papa says, so
 we <i>must</i> have arms."&#8212;</p>

<p>"I remember"&#8212;said <span class="smcap">Fred</span>, as grave as a
judge&#8212;"once, a little in his
cups, your father told me all about it. I recollect. Very beautiful
arms: a Normandy pippin with an uplifted battle-axe."</p>

<p>"I never heard that"&#8212;said I&#8212;"but that seems handsome."</p>

<p>"Yes; your ancestor sold apples in the camp. A fact, I assure you. It
all comes upon me now. Real Normandy pippins. They show a tree at
Battle&#8212;this your father told me as a secret; but as man and wife are
one, why it's only one half talking to the other half&#8212;a tree at Battle
grown from your ancestor's apple-pips. Something like a family tree,
that."</p>

<p>"I don't believe a word of it," said I.</p>

<p>"You must. Bless you"&#8212;said <span class="smcap">Fred</span>&#8212;"arms come
 by faith, or how many of
the best of people would be without 'em. There's something innocent in
the pippin: besides it would paint well. And with my arms"&#8212;</p>

<p>"Yes;" I cried; "and what are they, <span class="smcap">Fred</span>?"</p>

<p>"Well, it's odd: we were&#8212;it's plain&#8212;made for one another. I came from
Normandy too."</p>

<p>"You <i>did</i>?" and I <i>was</i> pleased.</p>

<p>"Yes," said he. "I wonder what terms our families were on a thousand
years ago? To be sure, I came to England later than you; and I can't
exactly say who I came with: but then&#8212;for I'm sure I can trust my
grandmother&#8212;my descent is very historical. I assure you that your
family pippin will harmonize with my bearings beautifully."</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>

<p>"We'll have the hall-chairs painted," said I, and I felt quite
pleased.</p>

<p>"And the gig of course," said <span class="smcap">Fred</span>.</p>

<p>"Of course; for what is life if one doesn't enjoy it?" said I.</p>

<p>"Very true, love. And the stable-bucket," continued <span class="smcap">Fred</span>.</p>

<p>"Just as you please, dear," said I; "but certainly the hall-lamp."&#8212;</p>

<p>"Yes: and if we could only get&#8212;no, but that's too much to expect,"
said
<span class="smcap">Fred</span>.</p>

<p>"What's too much?" I asked; for <span class="smcap">Fred's</span>
manner quite excited me.</p>

<p>"Why, I was thinking, if we could get your great aunt merely to die,
we
might turn out a very pretty hatchment."&#8212;</p>

<p>"Now, <span class="smcap">Frederick</span>!"&#8212;for this was going too
far.</p>

<p>"I assure you, my love"&#8212;said <span class="smcap">Fred</span>&#8212;"'twould
 give us a great lift in the
neighbourhood: and as you say, what's existence without enjoying
it?&#8212;What's life without paint?"</p>

<p>"Well, but"&#8212;for he hadn't told me&#8212;"but your descent, love? Is it so
very historical?"</p>

<p>"Very. I come in a direct line&#8212;so direct, my darling, you might think
it was drawn by a ruler&#8212;a direct line from <span class="smcap">Joan of
Arc</span>."</p>

<p>"Is it true?" I cried.</p>

<p>"When we cross over to Dieppe, it isn't far to Rouen. You'd like to
see
Rouen?"</p>

<p>"Very much, indeed," I answered. "I always wanted to see Normandy;
the
home of my ancestors;" and I <i>did</i> feel a little elevated.</p>

<p>"It's very natural, <span class="smcap">Lotty</span>"&#8212;said <span class="smcap">Fred</span>. "A reasonable, yes, a very
reasonable ambition. Well, at Rouen, I have no doubt I can show you my
family tree; at the same time, I shouldn't wonder if we could obtain
some further authentic intelligence about your pippin."&#8212;</p>

<p>"Nothing more likely," said I; for I <i>did</i> want to see France.
"Nothing
more likely."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid there's no regular packet across"&#8212;said <span class="smcap">Fred</span>&#8212;"but we can
hire a boat."&#8212;</p>

<p>"A boat? Why, my dear, a boat is"&#8212;</p>

<p>"Yes; in a nice trim sea-boat we can cross admirably; and, my love,"
said <span class="smcap">Fred</span>, moving close and placing his arm
about me&#8212;"my love, the
matter grows upon me. Let us consider it. Here we are about to begin the
world. In fact, I think I may say, we have begun it."&#8212;</p>

<p>"Mamma always said marriage wasn't beginning, but settling."</p>

<p>"Let us say the beginning of the settling. Well, we are at a very
interesting point of our history; and who knows what may depend upon our
voyage?"&#8212;</p>

<p>"Still, you'll never go in a boat that"&#8212;but he put his hand over my
mouth, and went on.</p>

<p>"I declare, beloved <span class="smcap">Lotty</span>, when I look
upon ourselves&#8212;two young
creatures&#8212;going forth upon the waters to search for and authenticate
our bearings&#8212;when I reflect, my darling, that not merely ourselves, but
our unborn great grandchildren"&#8212;</p>

<p>"Don't be foolish, <span class="smcap">Fred</span>," said I; but he <i>would</i>.</p>

<p>"That our great grandchildren, at this moment in the dim regions of
probability, and in the still dimmer limbo of possibility"&#8212;</p>

<p>"Now, what <i>are</i> you talking about?" I asked; but he was in one
of his
ways, and it was of no use.</p>

<p>"Are, without being awake to the fact, acutely interested in our
discovery; why our voyage becomes an adventure of the deepest, and the
most delicate interest. Open your fancy's eye, my love, and looking into
futurity, just glance at that magnificent young man, your grandson"&#8212;</p>

<p>"Now, I tell you what, <span class="smcap">Fred</span>, don't be
foolish; for I shall look at
nothing of the sort," and with the words, I shut my eyes as close as
shells.</p>

<p>"Or that lovely budding bride, your grand-daughter"&#8212;</p>

<p>"No," said I, "nor any grand-daughter, either; there's <i>quite time</i>
enough for <i>that</i>."</p>

<p>"Any way, my love, those dearest beings are vitally interested in the
matter of our voyage. Therefore, I'll at once go and charter a boat.
Would you like it with a deck?"&#8212;</p>

<p>"Why, my love, my dearest&#8212;as for a boat, I"&#8212;and I felt alarmed.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Columbus</span> found America almost in a punt,"
 said <span class="smcap">Fred</span>; "then surely we
may seek our arms in"&#8212;</p>

<p>"But stop," I cried; for he was really going. "After all, love," and I
resolutely seated myself on his knee, and held him round the
neck&#8212;"after all, you have not told me what <i>are</i> your arms? I mean
your
arms from <span class="smcap">Joan of Arc</span>."</p>

<p>"Why, you know, my love, that <span class="smcap">Joan of Arc</span>
was a shepherdess?"</p>

<p>"I should hope I knew as much as that," said I.</p>

<p>"Very good. Well, in order to perpetuate the beautiful humility of
her
first calling, <span class="smcap">Charles the Seventh</span>
magnificently permitted her and all
her descendants, to carry in her shield&#8212;a lamb's fry!"</p>

<p>"Now, <span class="smcap">Frederick</span>!"</p>

<p>"Such are my bearings, inherited in a direct line&#8212;I say in a direct
line&#8212;from the <span class="smcap">Maid of Orleans</span>!"&#8212;</p>

<p>"From the <span class="smcap">Maid of</span>&#8212;" and then I saw what a
goose he had made of me; and
didn't I box his ears, but not to hurt him; and didn't we afterwards
agree that the hall-chairs should remain as they were, and that life
might be beautiful and bright enough without a touch of herald's paint.</p>

<p>How we <i>did</i> laugh at the family pippin!</p>

<h2>GARDENS WITHOUT A WATERPOT.</h2>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 30%;">

<img src="images/014.png" alt="Cartoon--Mr. Punch." width="100%" /></a>
</div>

<p>A well-founded objection has been raised against the Zoological
Gardens;
one objection: and that the only one that we can think of. It is
complained, with truth, that no proper liquor is provided for the
children to drink there. Ginger-beer, soda-water, and lemonade are not
fit for children at all times, if they are fit at any, and cherry-brandy
is good for nobody; not even for the young ladies who alone drink it;
for it neither quenches thirst, nor causes hilarity: which are the sole
valid reasons for drinking anything whatever, except physic. It appears
that the only juvenile taps in the Gardens are those which supply water
to the gardeners. If these afforded the pure element, it would be all
very well; but their contents are much more suitable for the nourishment
of plants than for the refreshment of little boys and girls. Numerous
and interesting as are the varieties of the animal creation contained in
these Gardens, the collection does not include that useful individual of
the mammalia, the common cow, to produce a drop of milk for the little
ones.</p>

<p>Even if children could drink soda-water and cherry-brandy, it would
be,
for many a father of a family which he takes to the Zoological Gardens
for a holiday, much too heavy a disbursement to treat his progeny with
soda-waters and cherry-brandies all round. If the Society cannot manage
to add an ordinary milch cow to their quadrupeds, they might, at least,
establish the cow with an iron tail. They have evinced great solicitude
for the comforts of all the specimens of the inferior orders of animals
on their grounds; and doubtless, now that their attention has been
directed to the subject, they will make the requisite provision for a
very pressing want experienced by the young of the genus Homo. With such
a fact before them as the Camp at Chobham, they would indeed be
inexcusable if they were not immediately to rectify a glaring deficiency
in their Commissariat for the Infantry.</p>

<h4>Meat for Mawworms.</h4>

<p>The gin-shop keepers and Sabbatarians ought to get up a petition to
the
<span class="smcap">Queen</span>, praying <span class="smcap">Her
Majesty</span> to remove <span class="smcap">Sir William Molesworth</span>
 from her
councils, because the Right Hon. Baronet has directed the Royal Pleasure
Grounds at Kew, and the Royal Botanic Gardens also, to be opened on
Sundays; which must cause a shocking desecration of Sunday to be
committed in the enjoyment of flowers and fresh air, accompanied by an
equally awful decrease in the consumption of "Cream of the Valley."</p>

<h4>THE BANK OF RUSSIA.</h4>

<p>The House of <span class="smcap">Nesselrode</span> and Co. has issued

<h2>A HINT FROM THE GALLERY.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Punch</span> observes that his friends the
parliamentary reporters did a
sensible thing lately. An Irish faction-fight was detaining the House of
Commons from its bed at the unseemly hour of three in the morning, and
seemed likely to last until six. As the dawn broke, the gentlemen of the
gallery, wearied with the gesticulations of <span class="smcap">Lord
Claude Clamourous</span>&#8212;for
the best Peter Waggey that ever came out of the Lowther Arcade ceases to
amuse after a time&#8212;wearied with the iterations of <span class="smcap">Lord
 Chaos</span>, for a man
cannot always have an eminent statesman, or an old friend, to carp
at&#8212;wearied with what <span class="smcap">Mr. Gladstone</span> gently
called the "freshness" of <span class="smcap">Mr.
Connoodle</span>, fresh as dew from the mountain&#8212;the reporters, we say,
suddenly shut up their note-books, and retired into their own apartment.
The tongues of the Irish orators faltered, they looked up piteously at
the long row of empty benches, murmured that it was unreasonable that
the reporters should think that eleven hours and a half of talk was as
much as the journals for which they work could conscientiously
republish, and the profitless squabble was brought to a speedy close.
<i>Mr. Punch</i> cordially approves of the remedy, and suggests that on
another and a similar occasion it be tried a little earlier.</p>

<h2>MRS. MAGNALL'S HISTORICAL QUESTIONS</h2>

<center>(<i>As they should be written for Young Ladies</i>).</center>

<p>A history of England for young ladies remains yet to be written. The
usual ingredients of a reign cannot be interesting to the youthful
female mind. Battles, with the number of killed and wounded; party
feuds, with the names of the ministers who succeed one another in place;
the slow march of public events, and the men who march slowly with them;
the eternal round of diplomatic and political relations&#8212;which, as they
never marry, are the last relations a lady cares for; these, we say, are
not exactly the subjects that would engage the sympathies or the
attention of a young girl. What romance, what possible interest is there
in any one of them? No! we would change all that, and have our English
History written in a style popular, easy, and graceful, and alluding
only to such subjects as ladies understand, or can best appreciate.</p>

<p>Our proposal, however, will be at once apparent by the nature of the
following questions, which we have extracted from a History supposed to
be written according to our sensible plan;&#8212;</p>

<h4>HISTORICAL QUESTIONS FOR LADIES.</h4>

<center>(<i>Taken principally from the Reign of</i> <span class="smcap">queen
 Victoria</span>.)</center>

<p>What do you mean by the "Crush-Room of the Opera;" and why is it so
called?</p>

<p>When did <i>gigot</i> sleeves go out of fashion, and did such sleeves
 have
anything to do with the popular French phrase of "<i>Revenons à nos
Moutons?</i>"</p>

<p>What do you mean by "Crochet Work"? and can you set the pattern for
ladies of "How to make a purse for your brother?"</p>

<p>Who edited the "Book of Beauty?" and mention a few of the
aristocratic
names whose portraits have had the honour of appearing in its splendid
pages.</p>

<p>Can you describe the habits and haunts of the "Swedish Nightingale?"
and
can you mention the highest note it ever reached, and also why it sang
in a Haymarket?</p>

<p>State the name of the "Bohemian nobleman" who first brought over the
Polka to England.</p>

<p>In what year of <span class="smcap">Victoria's</span> reign was the
celebrated <i>Bal Costumé</i> given
at Buckingham Palace? and describe the dress that <span class="smcap">Her Majesty</span> wore on
that interesting occasion.</p>

<p>Give the names of the principal singers who distinguished themselves
at
the two Italian Operas during the rival administrations of <span class="smcap">Gye</span> and
<span class="smcap">Lumley</span>, and describe the nature of the feud
that existed between those
two great men.</p>

<p>Give a description of "Pop Goes the Weasel," and state all you know
about the "Weasel," and what was the origin of his going "Pop."</p>

<p>Who succeeded <span class="smcap">Wigan</span> in the <i>Corsican
Brothers</i>?</p>

<p>Mention the names of the principal watering-places, and say which was
considered the more fashionable of the two&#8212;Margate, or Gravesend?</p>

<p>When did flounces come into fashion, and state the lowest and the
highest number a lady could wear?</p>

<p>Describe the position of Chiswick&#8212;and give a short account of its
Gardens, and the <i>Fêtes</i> that were held there every year.</p>

<p>What were the duties of the Ladies of the Bedchamber, and in what
respects did they differ from the Maids of Honour at Richmond?</p>

<p>Mention the names of the most delicious novels that were published
between the years 1840 and 1853, and name the character and scene that
pleased you the most.</p>

<p>Whose gloves do you consider were the best?</p>

<p>What was the last elopement that created any sensation at Gretna
Green?</p>

<p>State who was <span class="smcap">Jullien</span>? also, whether he had anything to do with the soup
that bears his celebrated name?</p>

<hr />

<h4>Tea-Table Talk.</h4>

<p>A lady living at Peckham Rise has nearly ruined her husband by the
enormous prices she has been giving for Cochin-China fowls. The poor
fellow is always pointed at in the neighbourhood, so the story goes, as
"the Cochin-China-pecked husband."</p>

<p>A gentleman at a party, where table-turning was the principal
amusement
of the evening, upon hearing that the power of turning mainly depended
upon the will, instantly recommended his wife, as he "begged to assure
the company she had a very strong one, and he had never known anything
able to resist it."</p>

<hr />

<h4>A Good Dirty Job.</h4>

<p>It is pleasant to find that the Commissioners of Sewers are stirring;
notwithstanding the result proverbially ascribed to stirring in such
matters: and we hope we shall soon be enabled to expect that the
Metropolis will be drained with some degree of rational assewerance. If
this great object is successfully accomplished, we take the liberty of
recommending that the Chairman of the Commission should be raised to the
Peerage, by the title of <span class="smcap">Lord Scavenger</span>.</p>

<h2>OUR HONEYMOON.</h2>

<p>FRIDAY, MAY 24, 18&#8212;.</p>

<p>I am not superstitious&#8212;certainly not: but when I woke this morning, I
felt as if something would happen; though I said nothing to <span class="smcap">Fred</span>. With
the feeling that came upon me, I wouldn't have thought of going to
France for worlds. I felt as if a war must break out, or something.</p>

<p>"I knew it; I was certain of it," said I, when I'd half read the
letter
from home.</p>

<p>"In that case," said <span class="smcap">Fred</span>, in the most
unconcerned way, which he <i>will</i>
call philosophy, whereas I think it downright imprudence&#8212;but I fear
dear Mamma's right; all men are imprudent&#8212;"In that case, we might have
saved postage."</p>

<p>"Now <span class="smcap">Fred</span>, don't be frivolous. But I see,
there'll be nothing right at
home till we get fairly back. Everything will be sacrificed."&#8212;</p>

<p>"Is that your serious belief, my love?" said <span class="smcap">Fred</span>,
 finishing his tea;
and I nodded very decidedly.&#8212;"Well, then, suppose we pack up our traps
and return to-day. And talking of home, you can't think, <span class="smcap">Lotty</span>, what a
present you've made me without knowing it."</p>

<p>"Have I indeed? What present, love?"&#8212;</p>

<p>"It was in my sleep; but then, it was one of those dreams that always
forerun the reality. Do you know I dreamt that we'd returned home, and
somehow when I tried to sit down in my chair, up I jumped again; and so
again and again. Whenever I tried to be quiet and stretch my legs out at
my fireside, I seemed possessed with a legion of imps that would lift me
from my seat and pull me towards the door."&#8212;</p>

<p>"Hm! That's a very ugly dream, <span class="smcap">Fred</span>," said
 I; and I know I looked
thoughtful.</p>

<p>"Very: but it's wonderful how, like a tranquillizing spirit, you
appeared upon the scene. I thought, my dear, you looked more beautiful
than is possible."&#8212;</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Frederick!</span>"&#8212;</p>

<p>"Not but what I'm quite content as it is. You know, my love, it might
have been worse."&#8212;</p>

<p>"Well," said I, "Mamma needn't have written to me that my honeymoon
was
nearly ended. It seems I'm not likely to forget <i>that</i>."</p>

<p>"And when it was impossible for me to remain in the chair&#8212;when I
continued to get up and sit down, and run here and run there&#8212;- then, as
I say, you appeared like a benevolent fairy&#8212;bearing across one arm what
seemed to me a rainbow turned to silk; and in the other hand carrying a
pair of slippers."</p>

<p>"Well; and then?"&#8212;</p>

<p>"And then, with a thought, I had put on the morning-gown;&#8212;for it was
that you carried&#8212;and placed my feet in the slippers. There never were
more beautiful presents; never richer gifts for a wife to make her
husband. For would you think it, <span class="smcap">Lotty</span>? No
sooner had I wrapped the
dressing-gown about me, than I became settled in the sweetest repose in
my chair: and the very walls of the room seemed to make the softest
music. And then the slippers! Most wonderful! Would you believe it,
<span class="smcap">Lotty</span>&#8212;wherever the slippers touched, a flower
 sprang up; flowers and
aromatic herbs! The very hearth seemed glowing and odorous with roses
and thyme. But then, you know, it was only a dream, <span class="smcap">Lotty</span>.
 There's no
such dressing-gown&#8212;and in this world no such slippers;" and then&#8212;I
could see it&#8212;he looked in his odd way at me.</p>

<p>"I suppose not, <span class="smcap">Fred</span>," said I; for I
wouldn't seem to understand him.
"And then, if such slippers could be found, where's the husband's feet
to fit 'em? 'T would be another story of the glass slipper."</p>

<p>"Who knows when we get home? But what's happened?" and he pointed to
the
letter.</p>

<p>"Well, then, the pigeon-house has blown down; and Rajah's flown away;
and a strange cat has killed the gold-fish; and, in fact, <span class="smcap">Fred</span>&#8212;as dear
Mamma writes to me; not, as she says, she'd have me worry myself about
the matter&#8212;in fact the house wants a mistress."</p>

<p>"I have no doubt your excellent mother is right," said <span class="smcap">Fred</span>; "and as you
won't go to France, suppose we make way for <i>The Flitch</i>. Do you
know,
<span class="smcap">Lotty</span>, I'm curious to know if&#8212;after all&#8212;those
 slippers mayn't be found
there."</p>

<p>"<i>I'll</i> take care of that," said I; "but you know, <span class="smcap">Fred</span>, we can't go
back yet."</p>

<p>"Why not?"&#8212;</p>

<p>"Why, you know our honeymoon isn't quite out; and"&#8212;</p>

<p>"And what of that? We needn't burn all the moon from home. What if we
put the last fragment on a save-all, and see it out at <i>The Flitch</i>?"<span  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>"It isn't to be done, <span class="smcap">Fred</span>," said I; for I
 knew how people would talk.
"Of course, 'twould be said we were tired of our own society, and so got
home for company."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless," said <span class="smcap">Fred</span>; "you take the
flight of Rajah, that dear
bird, with wondrous serenity."</p>

<p>And it then struck me that I did <i>not</i> feel so annoyed as I
ought. "Ha,
<span class="smcap">Fred</span>," said I, "you don't know what my
feelings may be; don't misjudge
me because I don't talk. I can assure you, I am very much disturbed;"
and I <i>was</i> vexed.</p>

<p>"Perhaps, then"&#8212;said <span class="smcap">Fred</span>&#8212;"you'll take a
little walk towards the
Steyne; and recover yourself? I've some letters to write, my love:
and&#8212;'twill do you good&#8212;I'll join you."</p>

<p>"Certainly"&#8212;said I&#8212;"of course; if you wish it," and then I wondered
why he <i>should</i> wish to get rid of me. It never happened before.
Yes&#8212;and the thought came again <i>very forcibly</i> upon me&#8212;it's plain
the
honeymoon's nearly out; and then I left the room; and as I left it,
didn't I <i>nearly</i> bang the door?</p>

<p>"Why should he wish to get rid of me?" I seemed quite bewildered with
this question. Everything seemed to ask it. He could have written his
letters without my leaving the house. However, I felt glad that I
contained myself; and especially glad that I didn't bang the door.</p>

<p>Well, I ran and put on my bonnet; and then just peeping in at the
door
to <span class="smcap">Fred</span>, said, "I'm going;" and in another
minute was taking my way
towards the Steyne. It was such a beautiful day; the sky so light; and
the air so fresh and sweet, that&#8212;yes, in a little minute, my bit of
temper had all passed away&#8212;and I did well scold myself that, for a
moment, I had entertained it. I walked down upon the beach. Scarcely a
soul was there: and I fell into a sort of dreamy meditation&#8212;thinking
about <i>that</i> morning-gown and <i>those</i> slippers. "I'll get 'em
for <span class="smcap">Fred</span>,
that I will;" I resolved within myself. "Roses <i>shall</i> grow at the
fireside; and repose <i>shall</i> be in his arm-chair. <i>That</i> I'm
determined:" and as I resolved this with myself, everything about me
seemed to grow brighter and more beautiful. And then I wished that we
were well at home, and the slippers had, for once and all, been tried
and fitted. The gulls flying about reminded me of Rajah: and I <i>did</i>
wonder at myself that I could think of his loss&#8212;that would have nigh
killed me at one time&#8212;so calmly. But then, as Mamma said, and as I've
since discovered,&#8212;it's wonderful what other trifles marriage makes one
forget.</p>

<p>There was nobody upon the beach: so I sat down, and began a
day-dreaming. How happy we should be at home, and how softly and sweetly
all things would go with us! And still, as the waves ran and burst in
foam upon the beach, I thought of the slippers.</p>

<p>I hardly knew how long I'd been there, when a little gypsey girl
stood
at my side, offering a nosegay. I looked and&#8212;yes, it was one of the
gypsies, at whose tent <span class="smcap">Fred</span> and I took
shelter in the thunderstorm.
However, before I could say a word, the little creature dropt the
nosegay in my lap; and laughing, ran away.</p>

<p>Such a beautiful <i>bouquet</i>! Had it been a thing of wild or even
of
common garden flowers&#8212;but it was a <i>bouquet</i> of exotics&#8212;and how
were
gypsies to come by such things? Then something whispered to me&#8212;"stole
them."</p>

<p>I didn't like to throw the thing away; and as I remained meditating,
<span class="smcap">Fred</span> came up. "Pretty flowers, <span class="smcap">Lotty</span>," said he.</p>

<p>"Yes: selected with taste&#8212;great taste, an't they?" said I; and I
cannot
think what whim it was possessed me to go off in such praise of the
<i>bouquet</i>.</p>

<p>"Pretty well," said <span class="smcap">Fred</span>.</p>

<p>"Pretty well! my dear <span class="smcap">Fred</span>; if you'll only
 look and attend, you'll own
that the person who composed this <i>bouquet</i> must have known all the
 true
effect of colours."</p>

<p>"Indeed," said <span class="smcap">Fred</span>; as I thought very
oddly; so I went on.</p>

<p>"Every colour harmonizes; the light, you see, falling exactly in the
right place; and yet everything arranged so naturally&#8212;so harmoniously.
The white is precisely where it should be, and"&#8212;</p>

<p>"Is it truly?" and saying this, <span class="smcap">Fred</span>
twitched from among the flowers a
note that like a mortal snake as I thought it lay there.</p>

<p>"Why, it's a letter!" I cried.</p>

<p>"It looks like it," said <span class="smcap">Fred</span>.</p>

<p>"It was brought by a gypsey," said I; and I felt my face burning, and
could have cried. "It's a mistake."</p>

<p>"Of course," said <span class="smcap">Fred</span>: "what else, my
love? Of course, a mistake."</p>

<p>And then he gave me his arm, and we returned towards the Inn. <span class="smcap">Fred</span>
laughed and talked; but somehow I felt so vexed: yes, I could have
cried; and still <span class="smcap">Fred</span> was so cool&#8212;so very
cool.</p>

<h4>Another Change in France.</h4>

<h2>THE BREAKSPEARE TESTIMONIAL.</h2>

<p>According to the <i>Athenæum</i>, a Cardinal's hat is about to go
round&#8212;in
obedience, however, to no new force or principle. Our learned
contemporary says:&#8212;</p>

<blockquote><p>"There has been only one English Pope, and of him there
has been
hitherto no public monument in the city over which he ruled. The
omission is now, it seems, to be rectified. A committee has been
formed with a view to collect subscriptions; <span class="smcap">Pio
Nono</span> has given his
blessing, <span class="smcap">Cardinal Altieri</span> his countenance,
and <span class="smcap">Cardinal Wiseman</span> has
received instructions to collect the money in this country.... The
sum named for the monument is £6,000 ... A magnificent memorial is
to be erected to him in St. Peter's. The attempt to elicit such a
declaration in England at such a time is a clever trick enough; and
in order to its success, one of the grounds of appeal to the pockets
of Englishmen shows a profound knowledge of the weak side of our
national character. Wherever <span class="smcap">John Bull</span>
wanders, it has been observed
that he carries with him a passion for recording his autograph. The
<span class="smcap">Browns</span>, and <span class="smcap">Smiths</span>,
 and <span class="smcap">Joneses</span> write their names on the
Pantheon
and Pyramids, temple and tomb. The Cardinals have had the wit to
make a direct appeal to this passion; they offer to inscribe the
name of every donor of £60&#8212;which they are willing to receive in
monthly instalments of 20s.&#8212;on the base of the monument of <span class="smcap">Pope
Nicholas Breakspeare</span>."</p></blockquote>

<p>Under <span class="smcap">Pope Nicholas Breakspeare</span>, <i>alias</i>
 <span class="smcap">Adrian IV</span>, <span class="smcap">Arnold</span>
 of Brescia
was burned alive&#8212;having first, we believe, had his nose wrung off with
red hot pincers. Who will indorse the sentence upon <span class="smcap">Arnold</span>
 by causing
his name to be carved on the monument of <span class="smcap">Nicholas</span>?</p>

<p>As nearly seven centuries have elapsed since the time when this mild
and
beneficent Pontiff flourished, there may perhaps be no portrait in
existence to afford any idea of his venerable physiognomy. With what
sort of a face to represent him, then, may be a difficulty: unless the
problem should be solved by a special miracle. Failing that, the best
plan would be to give him the features of somebody likely to resemble
him. <span class="smcap">Nero</span> might do for the model: but <span class="smcap">Nero's</span> is not an English face.
Under these circumstances <span class="smcap">Greenacre</span> might be
suggested: but as <span class="smcap">Adrian IV</span>
was a man of some force of character, perhaps, on the whole, it would be
better to choose <span class="smcap">Rush</span>.</p>

<h2>PUNCH AT A ROYAL CHRISTENING.</h2>

<p>It is not often that <i>Punch</i> has to protest against anything
that
happens at our own Court, but unless the Court Newsman has misinformed
us, there was something very objectionable in the proceedings at
Buckingham Palace on the occasion of the last Royal Christening.
Recollecting that the Sponsors promise in the name of the infant to
renounce "the pomp and glory of this world," we cannot help asking
whether the following description of what took place is not lamentably
at variance with the spirit of the promise that was given:&#8212;</p>

<blockquote><p>"The sacred rite was performed in the private chapel in
the Palace,
which was duly prepared for the occasion. Two rows of chairs of
crimson satin and gold were placed on each side of the centre, for
the use of the QUEEN, the Sponsors, and the Royal personages invited
to be present."</p></blockquote>

<p>This might pass as coming under the head of luxury rather than of
pomp,
but what shall we say to the next paragraph?&#8212;</p>

<blockquote><p>"The altar was lined with crimson velvet, panelled with
gold lace,
and on the communion-table were placed the golden vessels used in
the Sacrament, with salvers and two large candlesticks. Seats of
crimson and gold were placed for the officiating clergy. The font
was placed in advance of the <i>haut pas</i>; it was a most elegantly
formed tazza of silver gilt, the rim was formed of the leaves and
flowers of the water lily, and the base from which its elegant stem
sprang was composed of infant angels playing the lyre; in the front
was the Royal arms. The font was placed on a fluted plinth of white
and gold."</p></blockquote>

<p>Riches, we are taught, add to the difficulty of entering the Kingdom
of
Heaven, then why this profusion of gold to encumber the first step of a
Royal infant on his entrance into the Church which is to secure his
eternal happiness? "Gold lace," "golden vessels," and seats of "crimson
and gold" for the clergy, are scarcely the appliances that would seem
appropriate to the ceremony of receiving the "sign of the cross," which
is certainly not typified by any of the accessories of pomp and
splendour that abounded on that occasion. Surely this must have struck
on the mind of some one or more of the assembled grandees, who, if not
too much wrapt up in the idea of their own and the surrounding grandeur,
may have remarked that</p>

<blockquote><p>"Over the altar was a fine piece of tapestry representing
 the
baptism of our Saviour."</p></blockquote>

<p>If the tapestry told the truth, there would be no clergy in gold
seats;
no font appropriated to Royalty by a vulgar display of the Royal arms
over the front of it; and no infants or any one else "playing the lyre"
at the simple solemnity, of which a Royal Christening is but a gaudy
mockery.</p>

<p>As a further assistance to the infant in renouncing the pomps and
vanities of the world, we find that</p>

<blockquote><p>"The Heralds and Kings of Arms were on duty to usher the distinguished
personages to their places in the chapel, and conduct the Royal
processions. There were present <span class="smcap">Albert William Woods, Esq.</span>, Lancaster
Herald; <span class="smcap">Walter Aston Blount, Esq.</span>, Chester Herald; <span class="smcap">James Pulman, Esq.</span>,
Clarenceux King of Arms; <span class="smcap">Robert Laurie, Esq.</span>, Norroy King of Arms; and
<span class="smcap">Sir Charles George Young</span>, Garter Principal King of Arms; the whole
wearing their splendid tabards, and the Kings of Arms their distinctive
insignia."</p></blockquote>

<p>It is really sad to think that in an age which prides itself on
common
sense, and at a Court confessedly adorned by the many virtues of the
Sovereign and her family, conventionalism still holds such sway, that
one whom it is no flattery to call an ornament to her high position
still feels herself under the necessity of converting a solemn religious
ceremony into a vulgar display of luxury and vanity. Can it be supposed
that the admission of the Royal infant into the Christian flock required
the assistance of archbishops, bishops, and clergy on seats of crimson
and gold, the presence of Heralds and Kings-of-Arms, a whole bundle of
Gold and other Sticks, the Master of the Buckhounds, and the whole hue
and cry of Court "pride, pomp, and circumstance;" which, however
appropriate to some occasions, are utterly at variance with the
admission of an infant to a religion for which humility is one of the
chief requisites?</p>

<p>The Court is justly looked to in this country as an example; and the
<span class="smcap">Queen</span>, as mother, wife, and woman, is indeed one whom all would do well
to imitate. For this reason we still more regret the recent display
which will set all the servile crew of imitators to work to emulate, as
far as they can, the pomps and vanities of a Royal Christening. The
influence will extend down to some of the humblest ranks of society, and
we shall have the <i>Herald</i> and the <i>Post</i> full of accounts of how <span class="smcap">Mrs.
Jones</span> of Jonesville had the altar decorated, the Bishop got up, the font
covered with the arms of <span class="smcap">Jones</span>, and all the appliances of Royalty aped
at the baptism of the <span class="smcap">Jonesian</span> infant.</p>

<p>We have no objection to the party, and the banquet after the ceremony,
but when the next comes&#8212;and we hope there may be many yet&#8212;we
trust <span class="smcap">her Majesty</span> will use her own good sense, and release all future
Royal Christenings from the trappings of pomp and vanity with which
custom has hitherto entangled them. We must say, in conclusion, that
<span class="smcap">Her Majesty</span> is not responsible for all the pompous foolery against which
we have raised our voice, for it has been customary long before she came
to the throne, and she has, in many instances, had the courage and good
sense to abolish many empty observances. We hope, on the next occasion
of a Royal Christening, to find her exercising her own proper feeling in
divesting the occasion of all those forms which are at variance with its
spirit.</p>

<h2>CHOKING IN THE ARMY.</h2>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/018a.png" alt="T" class="cap" width="20%" />

<p class="cap_3">THERE is one species of Stock in the conversion of
which no difficulty
whatever would be experienced. Indeed, the experiment with this
description of Stock has been successfully tried in the Indian portion
of the British Empire; as is proved by the following extract from a
general order:&#8212;</p>
</div>

<blockquote><p>"The Commander-in-Chief is pleased to direct the entire
discontinuance of the leather stock in all the Honourable Company's
European regiments under this Presidency."</p></blockquote>

<p>The British soldier would be very much obliged to <span class="smcap">Lord
 Hardinge</span>, if the
gallant nobleman would please to convert his Stock from a rigid,
galling, strangling band of leather into a collar of more flexible
material. That common tailors occasionally discount bills is no reason
why "clothing Colonels" should have to do such a "bit of stiff" for
their men as the military Stock. The infliction of flogging in the army
has been greatly mitigated, even in the cases of grave offenders; would
it not be as well to abolish altogether the gratuitous punishment of the
Stocks?</p>

<hr />

<h2>SPIRITUAL MANIFESTATIONS GOING A-HEAD!</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Rev. Glendower S. Fibbs</span>, of Salem, U. S., has been induced, by the
extensive interest of the British aristocracy in the <span class="smcap">Spiritual
Manifestations</span> which have lately been introduced from America, to visit
this country with a view to the exhibition of <span class="smcap">Occult Phenomena</span>, on a
scale which, owing to the prevalence of an illiberal spirit of
persecution, has been hitherto unattempted in this or any other country
since the era of Egyptian magic. He is accompanied by three <span class="smcap">Actually
Possessed Mediums</span>, who will utter responses, and afford correct
information on doctrinal subjects, under the influence of <span class="smcap">Spirits</span>. He
has also, at the expenditure of a considerable sum, secured the
co-operation of a genuine <span class="smcap">Wizard</span> and <span class="smcap">Witch</span> from Boston, Mass., who will
prove the <span class="smcap">Reality of Sorcery</span> and <span class="smcap">Magic</span> by <span class="smcap">Ocular Demonstration</span>, to the
satisfaction of the most incredulous and determined sceptic.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Wizard</span> will evoke the <span class="smcap">Spirit</span> of any <span class="smcap">Deceased Person</span> who may be
agreed upon by the Party Assembled, and compel it to appear in a visible
form before the eyes of the Spectators, deliver predictions, &amp;c. The
<span class="smcap">Witch</span> will perform the much controverted, but undeniable and surprising
feat of <span class="smcap">Riding on a Broomstick</span>; and to illustrate the power of <span class="smcap">Sorcery</span>
over the elements, will raise a Tempest on a small scale by <span class="smcap">Brewing a
Storm</span> in a Tea-pot. She will also exhibit the marvellous <span class="smcap">Phenomena</span> of
<span class="smcap">Transformation</span>, by changing herself succesively into the shape of
various animals: after which she will summon her <span class="smcap">Familiars</span>, in the shape
of <span class="smcap">Cats</span>, <span class="smcap">Toads</span> and <span class="smcap">Spiders</span>, and finally, together with her <span class="smcap">Attendant
Imps</span>, <span class="smcap">Vanish up the Chimney</span>. The <span class="smcap">Witch</span> and <span class="smcap">Wizard</span> are really and truly
what they profess to be, having both of them effected a <i>bonâ fide</i> sale
of themselves for 100 dollars a-piece to the <span class="smcap">Great Master</span>, well known as
the <span class="smcap">Largest Slave Owner out of the States</span>.</p>

<p>The <i>soirée</i> to conclude with the <span class="smcap">Appearance</span> of the <span class="smcap">Deuce</span> himself, whom
the <span class="smcap">Rev. Glendower S. Fibbs</span> will raise in a magic circle upon the
platform, entirely divested of supernatural terrors which might be
calculated to alarm the timid and nervous. The circle will be so
carefully charmed, as to preclude all possibility of his breaking
through it, as effectually as if he were a bear on the top of a pole.
The object of the <span class="smcap">Rev. G. S. F.</span>, being to convince the Public of the
fact of Spiritual Existences, will, he trusts, meet with the <span class="smcap">Support</span> and
<span class="smcap">Approbation</span> of serious and enlightened minds.</p>

<h4>OUR RUPTURE WITH RUSSIA.</h4>

<p>We cannot help regretting that anything should be done by our
military
authorities to irritate the sore place which has been established in our
relations with Russia. We, therefore, read with a degree of pain&#8212;which
made us almost cry out, for we were really much hurt&#8212;that a letter
dated June 27th, 1853, has gone out from the Horse Guards, prohibiting
all general and staff officers from wearing Russia ducks by way of
trousers. Whether this is meant as an insult to Russia we are unable to
state; but we fear that Russia in the present sensitive state of affairs
will regard this declaration of war against Russia ducks as an
indication of a desire to provoke hostilities.</p>

little oil, and be able to do without any rest whatever. Our own shirts,
also, will be more comfortable to wear when we shall be enabled to think

<h2>THE KEY TO THE RUSSIAN QUESTION.</h2>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/021.png" alt="I" class="cap" width="28%" />

<p class="cap_2">IT seems after all that the great <i>casus belli</i>
between the Porte and
Russia is "Who shall keep the key of the Greek Church?" The contest is
to determine whether the key in question shall dangle on the watch-chain
of the Greek, or hang on the bunch with the street-door and other keys
of the Latin patriarch. We might as well allow the <span class="smcap">Emperor
 of China</span> to
interfere with us, and insist on appointing a protector of Temple Bar,
for the purpose of deciding whether the <span class="smcap">Queen</span>
 or the <span class="smcap">Lord Mayor</span> shall
have the custody of that rusty old myth, the Key of the City. It is
absurd, and yet awful to think, that all Europe should be kept on the
<i>qui vive</i> about a key of no real value, and which, in fact, nobody
cares about.</p>
</div>

<p>We think we can furnish a key to the whole difficulty, and we can
point
the way to a pacific solution of the question by putting the affair into
the hands of our friend <span class="smcap">Chubb</span> of St. Paul's
Churchyard, or our equally
enlightened friend <span class="smcap">Bramah</span> of Piccadilly. We
are convinced that either of
these ingenious individuals will undertake to dispose of the question,
"Who shall keep the key?" by furnishing each party with a duplicate. By
this arrangement either of the individuals claiming custody of the key
will have it in his power to avoid the necessity of either picking the
lock or picking a quarrel.</p>

<h2>ENTERPRISING UNDERTAKERS.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Ophelia</span>, in her madness, exclaims, "They
say the owl was a baker's
daughter." This was a delirious mistake. What they do say, or ought to
say, is, that the owl is an undertaker's son. For truly the son of a
certain sort of undertaker has an owl for his father: is an owl and the
son of an owl, that ominous bird which</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"Puts the wretch that lies in woe,</p>
<p class="i2">In remembrance of a shroud."</p>
</div></div>

<p>Witness the subjoined statement by a correspondent of the <i>Daily
News</i>:&#8212;</p>

<blockquote><p>"A member of my family is just recovering from an illness
 which, for
a time, kept all about her in daily apprehension. The fact of the
illness becoming known in the neighbourhood, I am forthwith
inundated with undertakers' circulars, in which all the horrid
paraphernalia of the tomb are set forth, together with the various
merits, "readiness," "dispatch," &amp;c., of the applicant, expectant of
his job, and all this is shamelessly, indecently, wantonly, thrust
before the very eyes of afflicted relatives, watching the sick bed
with feelings racked between the alternations of hope and despair."</p></blockquote>

<p>Precisely as the light in the sick chamber elicits the shriek of the
screech-owl, so does the muffled knocker attract the puffs of the
advertising undertaker. With the attributes of the owl, however, these
death-hunters combine the propensities of the crow and the vulture,
which repair to the spot whereon a creature is dying, and hover
impatiently about their prey that still breathes. Occasionally, no
doubt, the vultures and crows, by a premature bite or dig of the beak,
expedite the process of dissolution, and very likely the other birds of
prey not unfrequently do the same thing: for one of these undertakers'
circulars getting, by the folly of an old nurse, or any other
misfortune, into the hands of a person dangerously ill, would be
extremely likely to occasion a fatal shock, and convert the expected
corpse into an actual one.</p>

<p>The writer in the <i>Daily News</i> says that he called on one of the
 senders
of these disgusting handbills, and informed the sordid and unfeeling
snob that in case the services proffered by him were ever, unhappily,
required, he would undoubtedly not be employed to render them. It is to
be hoped that the determination expressed by this gentleman will be
strenuously acted on by everybody else; and that when any one gets hold
of a communication of this sort under similar circumstances, he will,
instead of flinging it in a rage behind the fire, carefully preserve it,
for the purpose of showing it to all his acquaintance, in order that
they may make a note of the advertiser's name, lest they should ever
forget it, and be induced to give any custom to such an odious brute.</p>

<p>Mind, however, that if you will associate sepulture with upholstery,
you
must expect to have upholsterers looking to sepulture with mere
upholsterers' feelings. You ought not to be surprised that undertakers
speculate on the prospect of a job at your house. It should not astonish
you if one of these gentry were to propose to measure your wife or child
for a coffin. If your funerals must needs be "furnished," your funeral
furniture will involve competition, and its incidental snobbisms. Put
away the soul's old clothes in a plain box, with decent rites and no
other ceremony. Deposit them where they may most conveniently decompose,
and deposit as little as possible of any value to decompose with them.
Why should it cost a considerable sum to put a small piece of organic
framework into earth? Whilst that operation continues to be expensive,
we shall be sure to be pestered by candidates for its performance,
invading the very chamber of sickness with tenders of cheap coffins,
reduced shrouds, moderate palls, ridiculously low hearses, economical
mourning coaches, and highly reasonable feathers.</p>

<h2>THE GREAT CAB REFORM.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> several years of grumbling on the
part of the public, we have at
last got a Government that has been "strong enough" to venture on what,
in the highly intelligent circles of Downing Street, has hitherto been
considered the "hazardous question" of Cab Reform. It is a positive fact
that until <span class="smcap">Mr. Fitzroy</span> took the matter in
hand, every administration has
been "afraid" of the introduction of a Cab Bill, lest it should have
opened the door to opposition, or, in other words, the public were to be
crammed into wretched cabs, lest the Cab-in-et should be turned out.</p>

<p>Everybody with half a grain of common sense was perfectly well aware
that Cab Reform would be one of the most popular things a Government
could undertake; but it has required several years to make this plain
fact intelligible in high quarters; and even now, there has been a
timidity in dealing with some portions of the subject of Cab Reform,
which, though the new Act is very good, as far as it goes, will soon
cause the public to complain. We, however, desire to give all praise
where it is due; and especially to <span class="smcap">Mr. Fitzroy</span>, who will go down to
posterity with his aggravated Assaults' Act in one hand, and his Cab Law
in the other, to say nothing of the County Courts' Measure sticking out
of his pocket. The sympathy shown by the present Government towards
riders in cabs affords a proof that we have in the
Administration&#8212;(now, reader, prepare to be knocked over by an
unexpected blow)&#8212;a few really Cabbin'-it Ministers. We will
conclude with a lyric tribute to <span class="smcap">Mr. Fitzroy</span>, adapted to the itinerant
air of&#8212;</p>

<h2>INSPECTION OF CAVALRY BY GENERAL PUNCH.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Major-General Punch</span> having appointed this
day for the inspection of the
<span class="smcap">Queen's</span> Piebalds, that gallant and
distinguished corps arrived at
Chamomile Scrubs at 9 o'clock in full marching order, and formed line
with rear to the railway, to await the arrival of the General. The
inspections of the General are generally looked forward to with much
interest by the cavalry, in consequence of their practical nature; and
this being so close upon the Chobham affair, a considerable amount of
cramming had been practised by the subalterns, who had given up their
days and nights to the getting up of their "echelons," "wheels,"
&amp;c.,
and the other interesting information afforded by the book published by
authority of the Adjutant-General.</p>

<p>The General arrived shortly after the troops, and immediately
proceeded
to business. He first inspected the ranks; and having ascertained (as
indeed had been ascertained before, in "troop," "squad," and "grand
parade") that the men's hair was cut according to the regulations, that
the whiskers were in line with their ears, and that their "boots were
polished and jackets were trim," he made a minute inspection of the
appointments, pointing out the mode of fastening the carabine as giving
ample room for improvement. The pouch he was particularly displeased
with, asking somewhat snappishly, "What the devil it did at the back
when it was wanted in the front?" He also made some observations about
the cartridges, blank as well as ball, which we couldn't catch. The
regiment then marched past by squadron, files, troops, threes, &amp;c.
While
ranking past by single file&#8212;a movement, by the bye, which is
particularly slow in more senses than one&#8212;the General resumed the
subject of the appointments, and paid particular attention to the
valise, and mode of packing it; but as his observations were repeated in
an after part of the day, we need not here insert them.</p>

<p>The sword exercise was next performed in a manner which did great
credit
to the adjutant. Indeed the pursuing practice, at a gallop, was
particularly exciting; the troops scouring the Scrubs in pursuit of
nothing, with a zeal and vigour which must have struck terror into the
heart of <span class="smcap">Nicholas</span>, or even his illustrious
namesake himself, had either
witnessed the scene.</p>

<p>The evolutions next commenced, <span class="smcap">General Punch</span>
 himself giving the word of
command&#8212;the practice he always adopts at his inspections, in order to
prevent the possibility of commanding officers cramming their troops
with a series of common-place movements. However, things went off very
well, notwithstanding. While the skirmishers were out the General took
the opportunity of again pointing out the great inconvenience, not to
say the utter uselessness of the pouch, which article of war, by the
bye, he seems to be properly "down upon." It was noticed indeed that
nearly all the skirmishers dispensed entirely with its use, putting
their ammunition in their breasts, or rather, in the breasts of their
coats. The gallant General galloped about from flank to flank with great
fury, "dressing" the line and the leaders with a nicety which must have
greatly pleased the adjutant. The manner in which he shouted "Up, up,
up, up the l-l-left!" "Back the r-r-right!" must also have been equally
approved of by that officer.</p>

<p>On returning to barracks, the General went round the stables,
attended
by the Colonel and the officers of their respective troops. It is this
part of the day's business that always causes the "funking" (if we may
be allowed to apply that term in military matters) of the officers. The
General being well "up" in all the minutiæ of stable economy, mostly
puzzles the officers with his curious information respecting straps,
buckles, wallets, shoe-cases, &amp;c., a sort of information which,
though
it may be thought "boring" to acquire, and though it may seldom be
necessary for officers to apply in quarters, would be found very
essential in actual warfare, or at Chobham, where it was not unlikely an
officer might be left without his "batman," and have to shift for
himself.</p>

<p>We give a specimen of the sort of information required by the General
 of
these affairs, premising however that he does not select an individual
officer, and subject him to a lengthened catechism; but good-humouredly
dodges from one to another, so that no one feels as if he had been
subjected to an "examination." The following may be given as a summary
of the answers elicited:&#8212;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lieut. So and so.</span>&#8212;Had been in the Piebalds
 4 years, a Lieutenant 3
years; has had command of the troop sometimes in the absence of the
Captain; had frequently sat on Courts-martial, which he considered a
bore: didn't know who rode <i>that</i> horse&#8212;didn't know the horse's
number;
the horse in the next stall was "rode" by a serjeant; didn't know the
serjeant's name; knew he was a serjeant, because he wore<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span> three
stripes.
Thought a cloak strap had something to do with a cloak, didn't know how
it was fastened; supposed to the saddle somehow. A troop horse had oats
and hay, and some pails of water every day&#8212;about so much; the exact
amount was down in the stable regulations which he had read&#8212;remembered
reading them once at the head of the troop when he first joined; <span
class="smcap">Lieut.
Whiffin</span> pelted him with nuts while he was doing so. Couldn't
answer the
question, "Do you bruise your oats?" there was nothing in the stable
regulations about that. Knew how to pack a valise, <i>viz.</i>,
"according to
the Articles of War and the provisions of the Mutiny Act;" knew there
was a standing order about it, didn't recollect the whole of it; knew
the forage cap "was to be placed on the heels of the highlows;" was
certain of that: thought on that plan the boots and spurs might be
rolled up in a shirt; blacking, and pipeclay-sponge along with the
socks; thought it likely that the cap wouldn't be in a fit state to wear
after being on the highlows, but couldn't help that; it was the
regulation. Knew what a private's daily pay was, didn't know what a
lance corporal's was; didn't know what either paid for daily messing,
didn't want to know; knew what <i>he</i> paid very well. Hadn't the
remotest
idea how much meat or bread would be required for fifty men, should say
a precious sight; didn't know whether the men were allowed beer, had
reason to believe they drank it, or something else sometimes. Didn't
know much about encampments, how should he? Had been reading up for
Chobham, couldn't find out whether the <i>ch</i> was hard or soft.
Rather
liked the idea of encamping, thought there would be some fun. Didn't
know much about pitching a tent; supposed it would have some reference
to keeping it dry; but his batman or some one else would attend to that
sort of thing. <span class="smcap">Gunter</span> was going to forage for
 their mess. Thought any
joking about campaign and Champagne stoopid: no one but a civilian would
attempt it.</p>

<p>The General wound up the day's proceedings by visiting the Hospital,
School Room, Library, and outhouses; and&#8212;having satisfied himself as to
the state of the barracks, read all the books in the library, examined
every man's accounts in each troop, ascertained the particulars of every
case in hospital&#8212;adjourned to the mess, where the festivities were kept
with the usual spirit of the Piebalds.</p>

to improve my mind, expand my faculties, elevate my ideas&#8212;and all that
sort of thing&#8212;and in this proper disposition I go to the British
Museum: which I find shut.</p>

<p>"I don't know how this is. My own fault? I ought to know that the

is only open on certain days? Yes, I ought&#8212;but I don't. I forget the
days. I can't remember them; and other people who are not so indolent as
I am, and take pains to recollect them, forget them too.</p>

<p>"Besides, if I am indolent, I am one of the British Public, for whose
use and amusement the British Museum is meant, and think its
arrangements ought, in a reasonable measure, to be accommodated to my
indolence.</p>

<p>"But what you will, perhaps, regard as a consideration of greater
weight, there are numerous persons who only get a leisure day
occasionally; and that leisure, like my fit of diligence, is safe to
occur on a day when the Museum is closed.</p>

<p>"Why not throw the British Museum open every day, except on the few
days
when it may be necessary, if it is necessary, that artists should have
it all to themselves&#8212;like the National Gallery? What good do the
statues, the stuffed animals, the antiquities, and the mummies do half
their time, wasting their sweetness on the desert&#8212;or at least the
vacant&#8212;air? It would be much better if they were putting some ideas
into my vacant mind.</p>

<p>"I wish, like a good fellow, you would attend to this, as Chief
Commissioner of Works, and have the British Museum thrown open, or get
the Trustees, or whatever you call the authorities, to throw it open
daily, or as nearly so as possible, to suit the convenience of

<h4>ANOTHER NIGHT SURPRISE AT CHOBHAM.</h4>
</div>

<hr />

<h2>DOMESTIC RESULTS OF THE CAMP.</h2>

<p>The Camp at Chobham has already so far answered its purpose as to
have
given a powerful impetus to the military propensities of the rising
generation, and there has been a considerable muster of troops in many a
nursery, which may, on this occasion, be termed a nursery for young
soldiers.</p>

<p>We lately had the privilege of being present at a Grand Nursery
Review
and Sham Fight, where the Wooden Cavalry, under the command of <span
class="smcap">Master
Jones</span>, stood a fierce attack from a division of tin soldiery
under the
able direction of <span class="smcap">Master</span> and <span
class="smcap">Miss Toddlekins</span>. The ground occupied was a
sort of table land, having for its surface a <i>tapis vert</i>, or green
cover. <span class="smcap">Master Jones</span> was on the spot early,
and the Wooden Cavalry were
at once disturbed from their bivouac; and the sentries having been
summoned from their boxes, took up a strong position behind some lines
formed of an open dictionary, which admitted of the soldiers being
disposed in double columns. The Wooden Cavalry looked remarkably well,
though some of them were evidently veterans who had been in the wars,
for there were many without arms, a few without heads, and here and
there a horse had been curtailed of a tail, or some other usual adjunct.
<span class="smcap">Master</span> and <span class="smcap">Miss
Toddlekins</span> now brought up&#8212;from down-stairs&#8212;a
considerable body of tin soldiery of every arm&#8212;though, occasionally,
deficient of a leg&#8212;and these having been drawn up exactly opposite to
the Wooden Cavalry, both sides were prepared to give or take battle.</p>

<p>The proceedings commenced by the sound of a trumpet feebly blown by <span
 class="smcap">Miss
Toddlekins</span>, and responded to on the drum by <span class="smcap">Master
 Jones</span>, when a smart
fire of peas, ably directed by <span class="smcap">Master Toddlekins</span>,
 was opened on the
wooden cavalry. The double columns of "<i>Johnson's Dictionary</i>" for a
time sheltered the forces under <span class="smcap">Master Jones</span>;
 but a sudden <i>sortie</i> made
by <span class="smcap">Miss Toddlekins</span> shook the opposing force
with such violence that
several fell <i>en masse</i>, and the <i>mêleé</i> becoming general,
great numbers
on both sides were savagely put to the pea-shooter. The forces under
<span class="smcap">Master Jones</span> being now entirely put to the
rout, their young commander
grew desperate and threw down upon the foe all his strength, combined in
one enormous volume&#8212;of the dictionary already alluded to.</p>

<p>The loss on both sides was considerable, and among the casualties
must
be enumerated an accident of a rather harassing nature to <span
class="smcap">Mr. Jones
Senior</span> who, while surveying the field of battle, received in a
small
indentation on the right of his nose one of the largest peas of the
enemy. It is satisfactory, however, to add that the battle was decisive,
for no animosity remained on the minds of the young chiefs on either
side, who, having removed the killed and wounded, immediately spread the
<i>tapis vert</i> with a repast of the choicest jams, which they all
freely
partook of. The only soreness that remained was on the part of <span
class="smcap">Mr. Jones
Senior</span>, but his anger was soon appeased, and the peas were
speedily
forgotten.</p>

<h2>A FLOURISHING BUSINESS.</h2>

<p>Here is a bit of fine writing:&#8212;</p>

<blockquote><p>"We have been led to imagine that the dark cloud which
impended over
commerce in the time of the Star Chamber, had been scattered by the
onward progress of civil freedom&#8212;we have from early childhood been
thankful that we were not born in the days when serfdom crippled the
body and bigotry the mind of man, and we cannot think your Lordship
will pledge the legislation of the 19th century to an enactment so
offensive as this irresponsible police power is  to"&#8212;</p></blockquote>

<p>To whom? Well&#8212;taking "commerce" as a misprint for "conscience" one
might imagine that the remonstrants were "<img src="images/156b.png"
width="2%" alt="Maltese Cross" /> <span class="smcap">John Tuam</span>," <span class="smcap">Daniel</span>, or <span class="smcap">Dennis</span>, or
<span class="smcap">Dermot</span>, or whatever-his-name-is <span class="smcap">Cahill</span>, <span class="smcap">Frederick Lucas</span>, and other such
gentry&#8212;and clergy&#8212;denouncing a sanguinary, atrocious,
diabolical, fiendish, &amp;c. &amp;c. proposition for the deliverance of
nuns from false imprisonment. But no. The individuals to whom the
"irresponsible police power" is "offensive," are simply</p>

<center>"One branch of English tradesmen."</center>

<p>That is to say, they are the Metropolitan Omnibus Proprietors,
complaining by the pen of <span class="smcap">Mr. H. Gray</span>, their
Chairman, to <span class="smcap">Lord Aberdeen</span>,
against certain clauses of the Hackney Carriage Act. We dare say this
"one branch of English tradesmen" will no more be rendered subject to an
"irresponsible police power" than any other branch of the same tree; but
if "like master like man" is a true proverb, the proprietors of
omnibuses are gentlemen whom it is quite right the police should "look
after," and, at least, have power to make them "move on." We are glad to
see that they admire the onward progress of civil freedom, and hope they
will contrive to make their drivers and conductors stick to that; for
the liberty which those persons are in the habit of taking is too often
destitute of civility.</p>

<h2>OUR QUARTER'S ACCOUNT.</h2>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 40%;">
<a href="images/025.png">
<img src="images/025.png" alt="Mr. Punch with two ladies"
width="100%" /></a>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Punch's</span> Quarterly account has, like
that of the nation, been duly
made up, and presents equally satisfactory results with the national
finance sheet.</p>

<p>There has been an increase of 537 Epigrams on the corresponding
quarter
in last year.</p>

<p>In the Jokes department there has been no very great increase, but
this
is accounted for by the contributor whose business it is to make them
having fancied himself in love, and taken to ultra-sentimental poetry.
But we are happy to state that he has been unmistakeably thrown over by
the young lady, and will at once return to his duties.</p>

<p>On the Capital Hits the increase is very large, and although this may
 in
some measure be due to the military array at Chobham, there is no reason
to think there will be a drawback, especially as no announcement has
appeared of any intention to close Parliament or the Princess's Theatre.</p>

<p>On the Imports and Stamps, that is to say, the original plays, and
the
actors' displays, there is a small diminution, owing to a pair of
spectacles and the warm evenings, but <i>Mr. Punch</i> anticipates that
he
shall have a different account to give at his next return, and after his
next return check.</p>

<p>The Great Cuts show their usual average of 13 to the quarter, but
evince
the remarkable progressive phenomenon of each being more supernaturally
brilliant than its predecessor, and adding a new lustre to this
unparalleled gallery of Social and Political Satire, prompted by
Philanthropy, elevated by High Art, recognised by the Million, and
published at 85, Fleet Street.</p>

<p>On every item in the Miscellaneous List the return is comparatively,
as
well as positively and superlatively satisfactory. To the Bride in her
Honeymoon, to the Cabman and the Cabinet Minister at their respective
boxes, to the Bribed Elector in his Dungeon and to the Spirit Rapper in
his Sell, to the Artist before, the Candidate after, and the Soldier
under, his Canvass, to the woman-smiting ruffian, now (thanks to
<span class="smcap">Fitzroy</span>) catching it from Beak and Clause, to
 the spoiled juvenile at
the Jellies and the Undergraduate at the Isis, to the Actor at the Wing
and the Author at the Tale, to the Fisherman at the Perch and to the
Politician knocked off it, to the Turk by his Port, to the Guardsman by
his Tent, to the Policeman by his Cape, the Exeter Arcade Beadle by his
White Hermitage, and to the Masquerader by his patron saint <span
class="smcap">Jullien</span>,
<i>Mr. Punch</i> is delighted to say that they will all find their
account in
looking through his accounts for the last quarter.</p>

<hr />

<h2>ELECTIONS WITH ACCOMPANIMENTS.</h2>

<center>(<i>To the Member for Lincoln.</i>)</center>

<p>It is, <span class="smcap">Colonel Sibthorp</span>, as you say, a
mean, dirty, shabby, and
disgraceful measure&#8212;that Expenses of Elections Bill, which prohibits
flags and bands of music at Parliamentary elections. Flags, no doubt,
materially assist a thinking man in the process of deliberation, by
which he determines on a fit and proper person to represent him in
Parliament. But, waving the flags, let us more particularly denounce the
prohibition of music. The proposal, of course, arose from an absence of
music in the soul, and a fitness for treasons on the part of the
revolutionist who originated it.</p>

<p>But abuse, <span class="smcap">Colonel</span>, is not argument.
Relinquishing the former, let us
bring forward the latter.</p>

<p>Election music is an institution of our ancestors; and, <i>you</i>
may say,
was intended for the promotion of harmony between opposite parties. When
it was first introduced, philharmonic art was in the state wherein it
had been left by Saint <span class="smcap">Cecilia</span>, and had not
arrived at the perfection
which it has attained to under <span class="smcap">M. Jullien</span>.
The wisdom of our ancestors
was greatly in advance of their music; their common sense was acute, but
their perception of sweet sounds obtuse; they had "a reasonable good ear
in music," according to <i>Bottom's</i> idea thereof; let them have the
tongs
and bones&#8212;give them <i>Bumper Squire Jones</i>, <i>Old Sir Simon the
King</i>,
<i>The Roast Beef of Old England</i>, and the like, and they were
content.
Tunes that the old cow died of animated them: they were enchanted by
melodies that now only charm the hearts of broomsticks. Elevated,
however, they were by these old rugged but patriotic strains, and in a
state of elevation they rushed to the poll, and did their duty as men
and Britons.</p>

<p>But now, what with the performances at Exeter Hall and the Promenade
Concerts, what with hearing <i>Israel in Egypt</i>, and <i>Rigoletto</i>,
 and
<span class="smcap">Beethoven's</span> <i>Symphony in C. Minor</i>, and <span
 class="smcap">Mozart's</span> <i>Requiem</i>, and <i>Pop
goes the Weasel</i>, the public ear has got educated, and looks down&#8212;if
an
ear can look, as perhaps it can in a state of clairvoyance&#8212;on a
perambulatory orchestra of free and independent Britons: independent
chiefly in their playing.</p>

<p>What then? Abolish election music? Do away with a great institution
because it has been inefficiently carried out? No; to be sure. Improve
it, in accordance with the requirements of the age. Don't put down
election bands; but give them better music to play; not, <span
class="smcap">Colonel</span>, that I
shall contradict you if you say that there can be none better than <i>The
Roast
 Beef</i>, &amp;c. Have pieces composed on purpose for elections;
symphonies breathing loyalty and order together with a spirit of economy
and retrenchment; pastoral symphonies expressive of the feelings of the
agricultural interests; marches infusing into the minds of voters
courage to resist attempts at intimidation: overtures of a lofty
character, different from <span class="smcap">Coppock's</span>. At
Lincoln, where you could have it
all your own way, you might cause to be performed music descriptive of
dislike of the Whigs, and of want of confidence in <span class="smcap">Her
 Majesty's</span>
Government. There are, doubtless, musical effects representative of all
human emotions; disgust, even, at the recollection of the Crystal
Palace.</p>

<p>To prevent Ministerial jobbery, let the candidates have to find the
music; composers as well as executants; base is the slave who cannot pay
his expenses, and something more: like a gentleman, like yourself, and
like</p>

any candidates
who choose, as they have a right, to do what they like with their own.
The <i>Rogue's March</i> would be an appropriate air to celebrate the
next
return of the Noble Lord the Member for London. Eh?</p>

<h2>INFINITESIMAL LOGIC.</h2>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/026.png" alt="W" class="cap" width="35%" />

<p class="cap_3">WE agree with <span class="smcap">Professor Faraday</span>
 that there is something very startling
in the condition of the public mind in regard to scientific reasoning.
Here is a specimen&#8212;if correctly reported&#8212;of the ratiocination of a
British Legislator, and a gentleman of more than average education,
moreover, a polemic of considerable celebrity; relative to a simple
question of evidence. At a recent meeting of the "English Hom&oelig;opathic
Association," according to the <i>Morning Post</i>:&#8212;</p>
</div>

<blockquote><p>"<span class="smcap">Mr. Miall</span>, M.P., moved the
adoption of the report, and stated that
he had become a convert to the truth of the principles of
Hom&oelig;opathy from seeing their effects as regarded a
relative&#8212;though, thanks to the goodness of Providence, he had no
personal experience of them."</p></blockquote>

<p>To any one possessed of common understanding and decent information,
who
is accustomed to exercise the least caution in drawing inferences, who
has the slightest glimmering of an idea of the nature of inductive
proof, who does not, in short, jump to his conclusions like a kangaroo,
it is truly marvellous that any sane human mind should be capable of
such a generalization as the above. <span class="smcap">Mr. Miall</span>
 says that he became "a
convert to the principles of Hom&oelig;opathy"&#8212;whence? From carefully
sifting an accumulation of evidence, patiently comparing and analysing
hosts of facts? No; but "from seeing their effects as regarded a
relative."</p>

<p>This is just the mental process by which an old woman arrives at a
faith
in <span class="smcap">Holloway's</span> or <span class="smcap">Morison's
 Pills</span>.</p>

<p>Observe, too, that the thing which <span class="smcap">Mr. Miall</span>
 is persuaded of with such
facility, is one which is, so far from being in itself likely,
anteriorly improbable in the very highest degree, and, indeed,
ridiculously absurd on the first face of it.</p>

<p>It is curious how nonsensically men, otherwise intelligent, will
argue
whenever they meddle with a question relative to medicine. A man is
reckoned a fool for talking about any other subject which he does not
understand; but it seems to be assumed that there is a specialty in
medical matters, which admits of sound opinions being formed respecting
them by people who are entirely ignorant of them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Miall</span>, however, uses a correct
expression when he calls himself a
"convert" to Hom&oelig;opathy. Science has no "converts." Scientific truths
are either self-evident or demonstrable. Philosophical systems are not
"denominations" or "persuasions." It is systems of another kind that
exercise faith&#8212;such faith as Mr. <span class="smcap">Miall</span>
appears to repose in
Hom&oelig;opathy.</p>

<p>To medical nonconformity, however, let <span class="smcap">Mr. Miall</span>
 be welcome, if he will
only suffer nonconformity of another kind to constitute him no obstacle
to that "secular" education which is so needful a preservative against
all manner of humbug.</p>

<p>We say Amen to Mr. <span class="smcap">Miall's</span> thanksgiving
for never having experienced the
effects of Hom&oelig;opathy in his own person; that is to say, never having
experienced the effects of a serious illness unchecked by the quackery
resorted to for its cure.</p>

<hr />

<h2>A HELP TO JEWISH EMANCIPATION.</h2>

<p>The Jews are excluded from Parliament by bigotry&#8212;but not merely by
the
bigotry of the House of Peers.</p>

<p>Facts are stubborn things; they are also bigoted things: at least
Matter-of-fact exhibits a remarkable bigotry in regard to the Jews.</p>

<p>Last week, in the law reports, appeared the old story of the plucked
pigeon; dissipation, horse-dealing, bill-discounting, cheating, and
rascality. Bigoted Matter-of-fact, as usual, exhibited the scoundrel of
the tale as a gentleman of the Hebrew persuasion.</p>

<p>How is it, that if there is any villany, if there is any wickedness
of a
particularly dirty sort; a case of bill-stealing, receipt of stolen
goods, fraudulent gambling, marine store-shop, or other disreputable
establishment, the party chiefly implicated is sure, in the great
majority of instances, to be a gentleman rejoicing in the name, slightly
corrupted, of one of the prophets or patriarchs? For so it is, according
to bigoted Matter-of-fact.</p>

<p>While so much bigotry exists, a corresponding amount of prejudice
must
also exist, tending to obstruct the entrance of Israelites into the
House of Commons. For if the bigot Matter-of-fact's assertion, that in
nine cases out of ten a bill discounter, low-hell-keeper, fence, or
other trader in wickedness, is a Jew, be believed, then the supposition
that it is ten to one that a Jew is a rogue, is not very unreasonable.</p>

<p>Now the Jewish community is not numerous and poor, but just the
reverse;
and its chiefs are wallowing in riches. Would they not take the most
effectual means of getting their disabilities removed, if, by diffusing
education throughout their body, they could manage to abate that bigotry
of Matter-of-fact which ascribes to it so large a portion of
discreditable members?</p>

<h4>A Phrenological Puzzle.</h4>

<p>We are continually hearing of some individual or other who is
remarkable
for what is called an "Enlarged Benevolence." We wish <span
class="smcap">Mr. Donovan</span> would
explain to us the meaning of this phrase, for though we sometimes hear
of an enlargement of the heart, or of a newspaper having been
"permanently enlarged," we are puzzled to understand how there can be an
enlargement of an individual's benevolence.</p>

<h2>THE JOKE OF THE SESSION.</h2>

<p>One great cause of the heaviness of Parliamentary debates is the
jokes
with which they are interspersed, although these are not numerous. A
speech may contain but a single joke; but that one joke, or attempt at
joking, is such as to give a weight to the whole discourse which it
would not derive from the arguments advanced in it. To quote a House of
Commons' witticism is generally to quote <span class="smcap">Joe Miller</span>,
 whom Honourable
Gentlemen seem to cram in order to amuse, as they cram <span
class="smcap">Adam Smith</span> with a
view to instruct one another. Their jokes, like a very different kind of
things, Chancery decisions, are warranted by precedent. Liberals though
some of them may be in earnest, they are all Tories in fun. <i>Stare
super
antiques jocos</i> is the motto of the extremest Radicals among them.
The
boldest innovators of the Manchester School show a veneration for
antiquity as far as that goes. When the cellars of the House of Commons
are searched for <span class="smcap">Guy Fawkes</span>, it is wonderful
that no explosive matter is
found in them; no jokes in bottles, laid down many years ago, full of
beeswing, so to speak; old and dry. The foregoing reflections were
suggested by a report, in the Parliamentary intelligence, of the most
brilliant joke that has for a long time, as a gentleman in the Brigade
might say, shaken the walls of St. Stephen's. This highly successful
sally was made in Committee on the Expenses of Elections' Bill by</p>

<blockquote><p>"<span class="smcap">Mr. Elliott</span>, the Member for
Roxburghshire, who expressed anxiety to
know, as the clauses prohibited persons playing, whether in future
any of his constituents would be fined for playing the Scotch
fiddle?"</p></blockquote>

<p>If this pun is not very witty, at least it savours of the quality
nearest allied to wit. <span class="smcap">Mr. Elliott's</span> humorous
 question, moreover, is no
unmeaning joke. It expresses a feeling probably very general among his
constituents, who, we trust, will not, by any ungenerous legislation, be
deprived of that relief, under circumstances of suffering, which they
have always enjoyed under the ancient Scottish constitution.</p>

<h2>LAW ON ITS LAST LEGS.</h2>

<p>Of all the indignities to which the legal profession has been
exposed,
we know of nothing to equal the insult just passed upon it by the parish
authorities of St. James's, Westminster, who have advertised for a
first-rate lawyer to fill the place of Parochial Messenger. Our
assertion might appear incredible, were it not sustained by the
following extract from one of the <i>Times'</i> Supplements:&#8212;</p>

<blockquote><p>PAROCHIAL MESSENGER.&#8212;St. James's, Westminster&#8212;WANTED, by
the
Governors and Directors of the Poor, a respectable PERSON, of active
habits, to fill the above situation. He must be thoroughly
acquainted with the Law of Settlement, the practice at sessions
relating to appeals, and with parish business generally concerning
the poor. The duties and salary annexed to the appointment may be
ascertained at my office, No. 50, Poland Street, Oxford Street,
daily, between 9 and 6 o'clock; where also applications, accompanied
by testimonials of character and ability, are to be left on or
before Thursday, the 14th instant.</p></blockquote>

<p class="regards">By order,</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">George Buzzard</span>, Clerk.</p>

<p>Now every lawyer is perfectly aware that the law of settlement is a
subject so abstruse and difficult that a "thorough acquaintance" with it
can only be derived from years of study and practice at the Bar; and it
is, therefore, quite evident that the Guardians of the Poor of St.
James's, Westminster, expect one of the ablest Sessions barristers that
can be found to undertake the place of messenger. We will admit that
business has sadly fallen off, but we are not yet prepared to believe
that our <span class="smcap">Bodkins</span> and our <span class="smcap">Ballantines</span>,
 or even our <span class="smcap">Horrids</span> and our
<span class="smcap">Florids</span>, will yet be content to undertake the
 task of running on
parochial errands, and delivering parochial messages. We shall, however,
not be surprised at finding a forensic sergeant advertised for as a
sergeant of police, because it is necessary the latter should know the
law; but we hope it will be long before our <span class="smcap">Wilkinses</span>
 cease to ornament
our Bar by their splendid talents, and begin to exchange the coif for
the cape, or the big wig for the baton.</p>

<h2>A DAUGHTER OF THE CAMP.</h2>

<center><span class="smcap">Miss Caroline</span> <i>to her brother,
student at Haileybury College</i>.</center>

<p class="salute">"<span class="smcap">My dear Henry,</span></p>

<p>"Mamma and Papa desire me to say that they were very much gratified
at
reading that you acquitted yourself so well at the examination, and Papa
has given me a cheque to enclose which, I dare say, you horrid creature,
will make your sister's letter less of a 'baw' than usual. I sincerely
hope that you will profit by the address of that dear old white-headed
<span class="smcap">Sir James</span>, and learn to be "considerate of
the feelings and wishes of
those around you;" that is, that you will not grumble in the holidays at
having to take <span class="smcap">Julia</span> and me to the Opera, or
insist on smoking in your
bedroom when you know that the smoke comes under <span class="smcap">Maria's</span>
 door. However,
I won't scold you as you have been such a good boy at school&#8212;bless me,
College, I mean; ten millions of pardons, I'm sure.</p>

<p>"On Monday we all went to the Camp at Chobham, choosing the day quite
accidentally, but so fortunately. The next morning while I was cutting
the <i>Times</i> for Papa, I was greatly delighted to read this:&#8212;</p>

<blockquote><p>"'The ladies especially showed a surprising knowledge and
appreciation of the man&oelig;uvres performed. Should our brave
defenders ever be called upon to protect our homes and altars,
regiments such as those now at Chobham will not, despite the Peace
Society, want Daughters&#8212;though in these piping times they have
none.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>As to the last part, if one could hope to equal that dear divine <span
 class="smcap">Jenny
Lind</span> in <i>La Figlia</i>, one would almost not mind wearing the
odious
costume, though of all the ungraceful&#8212;but what do you boys know about
such things? I want to assure you that the first part of the story is
quite true, and shows that the clever gentleman who wrote it sets more
value on the opinion of young ladies than <i>some</i> young gentlemen do
 whom
I <i>could</i> name, but will <i>not</i>. Now, as an account of what we
saw must
be useful to you in your studies (though you are <i>only</i> in the
Civil
Service), I will tell you a little about it, and Papa says you are to
send him a comparison between the battle of Cannæ (is that spelt right?)
and the battle of Curley.</p>

<p>"We got a capital place for seeing, and we had not been on the ground
many minutes before some one blew a horn, and out ran numbers of those
large green beetles of Riflemen, and began to pretend to skirmish but,
as there was nobody to face them, they looked great sillies. But
presently there was a heavy tramping, and on came the Guards, looking
perfectly <i>splendid</i>, and ran up a hill. But I should tell you that
 on
the top of this hill were some Sappers and Miners (it seemed an odd
place to put them), and some soldiers with short guns, and when the
Guards had gone a little way up the hill, the others let off their guns
at them. Then the Guards pretended they could not advance any higher, so
the great cannons were set roaring off, and I thought I should never get
the throbbing out of my ears. Well, I suppose this encouraged the
Guards, for they made another rush; and, at the same time, the Household
Troops and the Light Dragoons went galloping and tearing in the same
direction, and looking as if they could ride over <i>everything in the
world</i>. However, they didn't, for it seems that it was necessary to
fire
more cannons, only this time it was the Horse Artillery. After this
there was great confusion, and I do not believe that <i>anybody</i> knew
 what
he was to do; however, they all got upon the hill, and their swords and
helmets sparkled beautifully in the sunshine. Lastly, those Highlanders,
with the legs, made a long line, and then gave way for the others to
come through it, like the opening figure in the First Set, and the green
beetles began popping again, and the cannons were let off once more.
Then they all went off the ground, and we had a dreadful to-do with a
gipsy baby, which <span class="smcap">Julia</span> had foolishly taken
to hold; and the mother went
away, leaving the brown little creature with us, and could not be found
until long after we were ready to go. <span class="smcap">James</span>
said that if we left it on
the grass it would be all safe; but this we would not hear of. The poor
child would have been the better for the tub you used to hate so a few
years ago when <i>Mr.</i> <span class="smcap">Henry</span> was only <i>Master</i>.</p>

<p>"Now, you are to say whether this was like the battle of Cannæ&#8212;I
don't
mean as to the baby, of course. And, if you will take my opinion, the
evolutions were all nonsense. I do not see the use of cannon at all, and
I am quite certain that, if the Guards rushed at an enemy as they ran up
that hill at first, the enemy would run away at once. Also I think the
cavalry and the infantry ought to be mixed up together, because then the
soldiers on horseback could protect the others, and change with them
when the poor men on foot were tired. Besides those dear horses never
kick, so it would be quite safe; a soldier told me that, as I was giving
his lovely black horse a sponge cake which he eat out of my hand. I
think that if you gave this idea to the masters at your school&#8212;College,
I mean&#8212;you would be thought very clever. But decidedly I do not like
the cannons, and I am <i>certain</i> they are of no use.</p>

<p>"You are to write directly to say that the cheque is all safe, and
everybody unites in love. <span class="smcap">Fan's</span> guinea-pig is
 dead. Baby has had the
measles, like the <span class="smcap">Prince of Wales</span>. Can you
polk better than you did?
What is good for my canary while it is moulting? Do not forget about
Cannæ, and if I have spelt it wrong take no notice to papa.</p>

allow even the hoarse voice of a cab-driver to address itself to the
polite ears of the public on the great question of Cab Reform, we must
protest against many, if not all, of the positions taken up and set down
by the editor of the New Hackney Carriage Act, in the following edition
of that useful measure. We have not taken the trouble to answer the
arguments of the unlearned annotator, inasmuch as we feel it to be quite
unnecessary; for every one will see at a glance what the cabman is
driving at.</p>

<h4>THE NEW HACKNEY CARRIAGE BILL,</h4>

<center>EDITED BY A CABMAN.</center>

<p>This here measure sets out at a sort of full gallop, which is nothing
more nor less than furious driving against us poor cabmen, by saying
that it is "Enacted by the <span class="smcap">Queen's</span> most
Excellent Majesty,"&#8212;which I
don't deny that she is&#8212;and "with the advice and consent of the Lords
Spiritual"&#8212;(them's the bishops: which I should like to know who ever
seed a bishop in a cab, or on a 'bus, and therefore what have they to do
with it?). The Act has twenty-two clauses; and every clause is intended
to stick it into us. I shall take them clauses one by one, and if I use
a little more license than the Commissioners like, they must recollect
they makes us pay precious dear for our license, so we may as well have
our say for our money.</p>

<p>1. Everybody who wants a license must apply in writing; so, if a poor
unfortnate feller can't comply with the letter of the law by writing a
letter which he never learnt to do, he must take to thieving, or
something else, for he mustn't keep no cab, nor nothing.</p>

<p>2. The Commissioners is to have power to inspect your wehicles and
your
cattle whenever they like, so that when your 'bus is full and your
passengers in a hurry to go by the train, you may all be pulled up while
<span class="smcap">Sir Richard</span> turns over the cushions, and sees
 if you've got any broken
windows in your 'bus, or any broken winder drawin' of it. Of course
nothin' will be good enough, unless we have velvet hottermans to keep
the insides warm, and downy cushions for the outsides, as if we wasn't
downy enough already. As to the horses, I don't know where we are to get
'em good enough. Praps they'll expect us to buy all the Derby winners
and them sort of cattle to do our opposition work with. But I suppose
there'll be a grant of money next year from the public purse, for
private speckelation won't make it pay anyhow.</p>

<p>3. Purwides that, if we don't keep hansom private carriages for the
public, and first-rate cattle to draw four on 'em about at
three-halfpence a mile a-piece, we are to be fined three pounds a day,
and go to prison a month for every day; so that, if we've done it for a
whole year, we may be fined upards of a thousand pound, and be locked up
for about five-and-thirty years. Consekwently three years would give us
a hundred and five years imprisonment.</p>

<p>4. This takes all the crummy part of the bread out of our mouths by
reducing our fares to sixpence a mile, which it used to be eightpence,
which meant a shilling. Never mind! We'll get it out of 'em somehow, for
we may charge twopence a package for luggage that won't go inside the
cab; and we'll take care nothin' shall go in, for we'll have the doors
so narrow that we can't be made to open our doors to imposition.</p>

<p>5. By this they compel us to have the fares painted up, and to carry a
book of fares. What right have we to turn our cabs into a library or
bookcase? When we make a mistake about a fare they always tell us we
"ought to know the law." Why ought we to know it better than them as
hires us? Let them carry books themselves. We've got enough to do to
carry them.</p>

<p>6. In case of disputes the Police is to have it all their own way,
for
what they says is law, and what we says is nothin'.</p>

<p>7, 8, and 9. Compel us to go with anybody anywhere; give him a ticket
with our number on&#8212;as if he couldn't use his eyes&#8212;and carry as many as
our license says&#8212;though, sometimes, one fat rider would make three; so
that if we get four such customers we shall as good as carry a dozen.</p>

<p>10. This is the unkindest cut of all, for it says we shall carry a
"reasonable quantity of luggage." Why, with the women, there's no end to
what they call a "reasonable quantity of luggage." I wish the Parlyment
would have just settled that for us; for, if four females is going off
to a train to spend a month at the sea-side, who is to say what will be
a "reasonable quantity" of bonnet-boxes, carpet-bags, pet dogs, and
bird-cages, that each on 'em may want to carry?</p>

<p>11. This makes us pay for other people's carelessness; for if anybody
goes and leaves anything in any of our cabs, we mustn't earn another
sixpence by taking another fare, but we must drive off in search of a
police-station; and how, in our innocence, are we to know where to look
for such places? If we don't, we must pay ten pounds penalty or stay a
month in prison.</p>

<p>12 and 13. Purwides for turning adrift all the poor old watermen, and
for putting Peelers in their stead. Praps they'll get a new Act next
year to make us keep all the poor old coves that are cut out of the
bread they used to get by giving us our water on the Cab Stands.</p>

<p>14. Says we shall have a lamp burning inside. Who's to trim it, I
should
like to know?</p>

<p>15, 16. As if we wasn't pitched into enough by redoosin our fares! We
ain't to stand a chance of getting an odd sixpence out of <span
class="smcap">Nichols</span> or
<span class="smcap">Moses</span>, or the Nutty Sherry, or any of them
dodges, that used to
advertise in our vehicles. There's nothin' said again the Railway people
a doin' it. But Guvament is evidently afeard of them Railway chaps, so
they are to go on doin' as they like with the public; and the public's
to do as they like with us by way of recompense.</p>

<p>17. This says over agen what's been said already about reasonable
luggage; and then says further, that we shall drive at least six miles
an hour. I should like to see one on 'em who made the law drivin' six
mile an hour down Cheapside, at four o'clock in the afternoon. But we
must do it, or pay forty shillins, or go to prison for a month, if we
like that better.</p>

<p>18. According to this claws if any feller wants to cheat us, or gets
up
a dispute with us, though he's in the wrong, and we right, we must drive
the gentleman in our own carriage to the nearest police court. This
ought to be good on both sides anyhow. And if we are in the right the
law ought to be that the gent who made us drive him should be obliged to
order out his own carriage, if he's got one&#8212;and be made to hire one if
he hasn't&#8212;to drive us home again.</p>

<p>19. As if there warn't penalties enough, this claws throws a penalty
of
forty shillin or a month's imprisonment in, for anything in general, or
nothin particular, at the hoption of the magistrate.</p>

<p>20, 21, 22. These three last clawses says nothin, and so there's
nothin
to say about 'em, unless to notice the stoopidity of sayin' that this
Act and two others shall be read as one, as if anybody could read three
Acts of Parlyment at a time, and think he is only readin' one&#8212;but it's
just like 'em.</p>

<h2>CHAGRIN FOR OLD COMMODORES.</h2>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/032.png" alt="A" class="cap" width="40%" />

<p class="cap_3">A recent leading article in the <i>Times</i> quotes a
return, which has been
obtained by <span class="smcap">Mr. Hume</span>, of certain statistics
relative to flogging in the
Navy; whence it appears that the amount of human torture inflicted on
British sailors, represented in the aggregate by 40,545 lashes during
the year 1848, had declined in 1852 to 17,571. In commenting on this
decrease in the torment of seamen, the <i>Times</i> remarks, that this
"odious species of punishment is falling more and more into disuse;"
and, moreover, that</p>
</div>

<blockquote><p>"Anything like a frequent resort to it is taken to
reflect
discredit, not only upon the whole ship's company, but upon the
officers in command."</p></blockquote>

<p>If a return could be procured of the number of imprecations uttered
on
reading the above passage, by bluff old retired admirals and
superannuated sea-captains, in clubs and coffee-rooms at our various
sea-ports, where they are accustomed to growl over the degeneracy of the
service, we should probably be presented with a startling array of
figures. By the stigma which is cast upon the discipline which these
veterans, for the most part, boast of having maintained, their feelings
must be as cruelly lacerated as they themselves ever caused the backs of
their men to be.</p>

<hr />

<h2>POISONOUS PUFFS.</h2>

<p>Something has been done, of late, towards the abatement of nuisances.
Cinder-heaps have been swept away, sewers trapped, cesspools closed, and
laystalls removed from under our noses. There still remains, however, a
great deal of noxious and offensive stuff to be got rid of; particularly
since, instead of merely contaminating our air and water, it infects the
fountains of our current information. It taints the library, it defiles
the drawing-room table. This graveolent evil is the pest of soiled
newspapers&#8212;journals of ill savour&#8212;not imparted by any fetid sort of
printers' ink, but by vile advertisements, whereat the physical
nostrils, indeed, are not offended: but the moral nose is in great
indignation.</p>

<p>An obscure and narrow street through which few respectable persons,
and
no ladies, ever pass, bears a scandalous name, and is considered a
disgrace to the metropolis, by reason of the sort of literature
displayed in its windows, which is precisely of the same quality as the
advertisements alluded to; and these, in the columns of reputable and
even "serious" journals, get introduced into families, and lie about the
house, to attract the notice, and obtain the perusal, of the younger
members of the establishment, male and female.</p>

<p>You may take up&#8212;or what is of more consequence&#8212;your little boy or
girl
may take up&#8212;a newspaper, and read, on one side of it, a leading article
which might be preached out of a pulpit: on the other a series of
turpitudes unfit for utterance under any circumstances.</p>

<p>These atrocities are heightened to the point of perfection by the
circumstance that they are the puffs of a set of rascally quacks, not
the least mischievous of whose suggestions are the recommendations of
their own medicines&#8212;poison for the body which they vend to simpletons,
whilst they disseminate mental poison gratis, both in the advertisements
themselves, and in books which form the subject of them, in addition to
the other poison.</p>

<p>As the newspaper-proprietors whose journals are sullied by these
putrescences may be of opinion that the odour of gain, from whatever
source derived, is agreeable, and, therefore, preserve them as rather
fragrant than otherwise, the following exhortation has been addressed to
their customers:&#8212;</p>

<blockquote><p>"It rests with you&#8212;with you alone, newspaper readers, to
stop the
torrent. And you can do it, without expense, and with but little
self-denial. Let each individual that receives this appeal write
without delay to the editor of the paper he reads, whenever he sees
it defiled by one of these easily-recognised advertisements, and say
that, unless its insertion is discontinued, he cannot, in
conscience, any longer patronise the publication. Whatever your
station may be, you can do something; and the higher it is, the
greater is your influence and responsibility. On country gentlemen
rests mainly the persistence of the evil in provincial papers; they
can, and we trust they will stop it. Let, too, each one of you that
are advertisers, be you publishers, men of business, authors,
masters seeking servants, or servants seeking masters, refuse to
appear any more in such company, and let it be known at the
newspaper office why you withhold your patronage."</p></blockquote>

<p>The above paragraph is extracted from the prospectus of a society
which
has been formed for the special purpose of suppressing this villanous
pufferty. The association is entitled "The Union for Discouragement of
Vicious Advertisements;" and we hope it will succeed in closing a
channel of communication which has all the qualities, except the
utility, of a gutter.</p>

<h2>THE ECCLESIASTICAL AUCTION MART.</h2>

<p class="salute">"<span class="smcap">Dear Punch,</span></p>

<p>Going the other day into an auction-room in a large commercial town,
with the view of purchasing a small fancy business, I found that having
already disposed of it, and of a cheesemonger's good-will and stock, the
auctioneer was endeavouring to sell a <i>church</i>, on whose merits he
was
expatiating much in the following terms:&#8212;</p>

<div class="poem1"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"Come, Gentlemen, pray give attention</p>

<p class="i2">In any one present has shone,</p>
<p class="i0">He may further exemplify each in</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">It is not some old weather-worn building,</p>

<p class="i0">But as fresh as paint, varnish, and gilding</p>
<p class="i2">Could make it, 'twas made 't other day;</p>
<p class="i0">And if any, who hear me, are pinning</p>
<p class="i2">Their faith some one order upon,</p>
<p class="i0">I can tell them they'll find a beginning</p>

<p class="i0">The fixtures are mats, stools, and hassocks,</p>
<p class="i2">And (as second-hand garments to don</p>

<h2>OUR METEOROLOGICAL REPORT.</h2>

<p>The public is much indebted to a gentleman named <span class="smcap">Lowe</span>,
 who lives at
Bermondsey, and writes every day to the <i>Times</i>, to inform the
world
which way the wind blew on the preceding day, how much rain fell late in
the evening, what amount of cloud was floating about at a particular
hour of the day, and other equally interesting particulars. On Tuesday
this gentleman reports his detection of some "cirri," and he kindly
writes to the <i>Times</i> to give the world the benefit of the
discovery.</p>

<p>Anxious to make ourselves generally useful, we have attempted a few
meteorological observations on our own account, and the following is the
report we have to offer:&#8212;</p>

<p>Barometer fell&#8212;to the ground and smashed.</p>

<p>Thermometer rose to blood heat&#8212;having been turned upside down by an
infant.</p>

<p>Direction of wind&#8212;right in our own face.</p>

<p>Amount of rain&#8212;.001 in. in our umbrella stand.</p>

<p>Amount of cloud&#8212;9 from our own tobacco-pipe. Should our scientific
observations as recorded above tend to throw any light upon anything, we
are more than satisfied.</p>

<h2>A BIG BROTHER OF MERCY.</h2>

<p>Besides the Plymouth Brethren, there are the Plymouth Sisters, called
Sisters of Mercy. These ladies, however, appear to stand in the
relationship of Sister to something else than Mercy; to Choler, we may
say, and Choler unbridled, so to speak, and rather asinine.</p>

<p>The <i>Morning Post</i> published the other day a correspondence
between a
<span class="smcap">Mr. J. D. Chambers</span> and <span class="smcap">Mr.
 Phinn</span>, M.P., which will probably be
considered to supply the foregoing remark with some foundation.</p>

<p>There is, it appears, among the Sisters of Mercy, a lady who is also the
sister of <span class="smcap">Mr. Chambers</span>. On her behalf <span class="smcap">Mr. Chambers</span> writes a letter to
<span class="smcap">Mr. Phinn</span>, to demand whether he, in his place in Parliament, made
certain statements respecting the community to which she belongs,
imputing to them systematic fraud and hypocrisy, and the endeavour to
convert their institution into a Roman Catholic nunnery.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Phinn</span> replies that he might decline to answer <span class="smcap">Mr. Chambers</span>, on the
ground of privilege, as well as on that of the intemperance and want of
courtesy displayed in <span class="smcap">Mr. Chambers's</span> letter&#8212;which rights, however,
he waives; says that he cannot reconcile newspaper reports of his words,
nor exactly remember those which he used; but denies that his language,
as reported by any of the papers, conveys the imputations alluded to by
<span class="smcap">Mr. Chambers</span>, or that he made odious and unsupported accusations of
fraud and dishonesty against the ladies in question.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Phinn</span> then proceeds to remind his peppery correspondent that the
late <span class="smcap">Queen Dowager</span> felt it her duty, after strict investigation, to
withdraw her support from the Society, on the ground that its doctrines
were at variance with those of the Established Church.</p>

<p>To this reply <span class="smcap">Mr. Chambers</span> rejoins, reiterating his statements as to the
imputation of fraud and duplicity, and concluding in the following
polite terms:&#8212;</p>

<blockquote><p>"My duty, therefore, as her (his sister's) protector, is
simply to
tell you, in plain words, as such your accusations are false."</p></blockquote>

<p>Everybody, of course, knows that the Sisters of Mercy form that
celebrated community which rejoices under the superintendance of a
single lady, writing herself "Y<sup>e</sup> Mother Sup<sup>r</sup>;" not being a mother, or
even a mother-in-law, or a mother in any sense known to the law, or in
any sense whatever except a Roman Catholic one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Phinn</span> merely expresses an opinion
about the Sisters of Mercy, which
is entertained by most other people, saving Puseyites at a temperature
of red heat. The charge against him of making false accusations is
itself an accusation that is untrue.</p>

<p>The convent, or whatever it calls itself, of the Sisters of Mercy, is
 no
doubt a highly respectable, though a pseudo-Roman Catholic concern.
Before <span class="smcap">Mr. Chambers</span> figures again as the "big
 brother," he should not
only make sure that the honour of his relative has been impugned, but it
will be well for him to consider whether he does her quasi-nunnery much
good by constituting himself a bully to the establishment.</p>

<h2>OUR HONEYMOON.</h2>

<p>SATURDAY, MAY 25, 18&#8212;</p>

<p>I cannot but confess it&#8212;I felt hurt, twitted by the easiness, the
unconcern of <span class="smcap">Fred</span>. Of course I should have
thought it very foolish, nay,
worse in him, to be jealous. That would have been ridiculous, unworthy
of him. Nevertheless, I could not help endeavouring to place myself in
his situation&#8212;to enter into the feelings of a husband, and to think
myself a man!</p>

<p>That a letter&#8212;and such a letter&#8212;should have been sent to me, was, of
course, a mistake. But, for all that&#8212;putting myself in the place of a
man and a husband&#8212;for that was, of course, the most reasonable and the
most natural way for a woman to come to a right conclusion&#8212;I could not
have been so calm, so tranquil, I may, indeed, say&#8212;so stone-cold.
Indeed, judging, moreover, from my own feelings as a woman and a wife,
it would have been impossible: not that I'm of a jealous habit of mind.
No, certainly; I should say, quite the reverse. Still, it is quite
plain, that if we really value and love a thing&#8212;we must be anxious
accordingly. <i>That</i> is but natural. Nevertheless, I cannot disguise
 it
from myself that <span class="smcap">Fred</span>&#8212;even after he had
handed me the letter to read,
and I&#8212;all in a twitter I must say&#8212;had read it to him, did nothing but
laugh. I've no doubt he was very right; and yet, if I know myself and
I'd been in his place&#8212;I don't think I should have <i>laughed.</i></p>

<p>"Read the letter, <span class="smcap">Lotty</span>,"&#8212;cried <span
class="smcap">Fred</span>&#8212;"by all means read it; it may
amuse us."</p>

<p>"To be sure," said I; "not that it can be for <i>me</i>." And then,
when I
opened the stupid bit of paper, it seemed to scorch my face and
something came into my throat, as I began to read the ridiculous
words&#8212;'<i>My dear and beautiful girl.</i>'</p>

<p>"Must be a mistake," cried <span class="smcap">Fred</span>: though I
thought I saw him just bite
his lip, and just a little wrinkle his eye brows. "But go on."</p>

<p>"'<i>I have beheld you in silent admiration; but now I feel longer
silence
impossible!</i>' I shan't read any more," said I, "for how can it
concern
me&#8212;I mean <i>us</i>?"</p>

<p>"Go on," cried <span class="smcap">Fred</span>, hooking his
fore-finger round his nose and rubbing
it in his manner, when he is thinking.</p>

<p>'<i>It is plain you were intended for a brighter destiny than what
has
befallen you.</i>'</p>

<p>"Come," said <span class="smcap">Fred</span> in his aggravating way,
"that's no compliment to me."</p>

<p>"To you! Then, if it comes to that," said I, "and if for a minute you
think this stuff was written to me, you may read the rest yourself." And
with this&#8212;with all the spirit I could&#8212;I flung the letter <i>at him</i>.
Yes; at him; and as he looked up, and a little astonished, but more
hurt, as I thought, opened his eyes at me&#8212;I felt myself so wrong, so
rebuked, that I flung my arms about his neck, and the next snatched up
the note to tear it to pieces.</p>

<p>"Stop, <span class="smcap">Lotty</span>;" cried <span class="smcap">Fred</span>;
 "as it is not our property, we've no right to
destroy it." And then he put the letter in his breast pocket; and, as he
did so, I had a twinge of the heart, a cold chill, for all the world as
though he had put a viper there.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Fred</span>, dear <span class="smcap">Fred</span>,"
 said I, and what ailed me I couldn't tell; but all I
recollect was that saying or stammering, "let us go home," I fell upon
his neck; and after awhile coming to myself, I found <span class="smcap">Josephine</span>&#8212;now
 pale
and now flustered&#8212;at my side. But still the wish was in my thoughts.
"<i>Do</i>, do let us go home."</p>

<p>"Well, <span class="smcap">Lotty</span>, love; we <i>will</i> go
home. In a little while; a very little
while; a day or two"&#8212;</p>

<p>"Now, <span class="smcap">Fred</span>; to-day."</p>

<p>"Why, to-day, <span class="smcap">Lotty</span>, is impossible. The
fact is, I expect&#8212;but never
mind;" and I felt sure there was something <span class="smcap">Fred</span>
 was hiding from me,
something I ought to know. But before I could reply, he took his hat and
left the room. I don't know what could have possessed me; but, for the
minute, I felt alone&#8212;all alone in the world; and the next, such a
newer, deeper love&#8212;I had thought it impossible to be so&#8212;for <span
class="smcap">Frederick</span>;
and then&#8212;but <span class="smcap">Josephine</span> was present, looking
so curiously at me, that I
was directly called to myself.</p>

<p>"You'd never think of going home, Ma'am, without a peep at France?"
said
<span class="smcap">Josephine.</span></p>

<p>"What I think can in no way concern you," I replied very freezingly;
for, somehow, I could not <i>quite</i> understand <span class="smcap">Josephine's</span>
 looks.</p>

<p>"Certainly not, Ma'am; only to be so near France, and not to cross,
what
would people say? And lace I'm told so cheap there! Not that I wish to
go myself. Certainly not. Oh dear no. Old England for me. I'm sure I can
stay here till you come back with the greatest pleasure in&#8212;no, not
exactly that: still, Ma'am, I <i>can</i> stay."</p>

<p>And the more she talked, and the more I looked at her, the more she
seemed in a sort of pucker and flurry that&#8212;I'm not suspicious: still,
it did appear mysterious.</p>

<p>"I shall not go to France. We shall return straight home, and you<span
 class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span> may,
or may not&#8212;just as you please, <span class="smcap">Josephine</span>, so
make it entirely agreeable
to yourself&#8212;go back with us, or stay here alone." And with this, I left
the room to join <span class="smcap">Fred</span>; and he&#8212;I discovered to
 my great annoyance&#8212;had
gone out. Gone out! It was very odd.</p>

<p>I couldn't rest indoors. So, without a word to <span class="smcap">Josephine</span>,
 I put on my
things&#8212;snatched them on I should rather say&#8212;and followed <span
class="smcap">Fred</span>. Up and
down the beach&#8212;but no signs of him. Where <i>could</i> he be?</p>

<p>As the time went on, and I continued to look for and expect him, I
could
scarcely contain myself. I sat down upon the beach; and the sun,
setting, looked so magnificent. I tried to calm and comfort myself,
making out a home in the clouds. Such a home! With such gardens and
golden plains and palaces of ruby pillars&#8212;but no; it wouldn't do. And I
felt all the angrier that I had so tried to cheat myself.</p>

<p>At the moment, who should glide past me&#8212;not seeing me, as I
thought&#8212;but the very gypsey child who had brought that foolish bouquet,
and that stupid note!</p>

<p>I resolved, taking a minute's counsel with myself, to discover the
individual who had employed the gypsey; so followed the child, who
suddenly seemed to guess my determination. "Want a nosegay, Ma'am?" said
the girl. "Buy a nosegay to get me a bit of bread."</p>

<p>"Now, if I buy this nosegay"&#8212;and the little creature looked at me
with
her glittering eyes, as much as to say&#8212;in her artful manner&#8212;she was
quite a match for me&#8212;"Will you tell me the truth?"</p>

<p>"Yes, lady; that I will, whether you buy or not, and sixpence will be
cheap at the money."</p>

<p>"Well, then, who told you to bring me that nosegay yesterday?"</p>

<p>"Oh," cried the perplexing creature, with a burst of enjoyment,
jumping
up and down&#8212;"such a gen'l'man! Give me a shilling."</p>

<p>"And how did you know me&#8212;I mean, did he point me out to you?"&#8212;</p>

<p>"Yes;" answered the little elf&#8212;for she looked to me like a
mischievous
sprite, she laughed as I thought so wickedly&#8212;"yes: you was with
another."</p>

<p>"Another?"&#8212;</p>

<p>"Yes: but that was in the fore-part of the day; and you both went
away
so quick, that you give me no chance; and the gen'l'man called me back.
When I seed you in the arternoon, then I give it you."</p>

<p>"And what sort of a&#8212;a gentleman?"</p>

<p>"He's now a walking&#8212;or was a walking just by the&#8212;but would you like
to
see him?"</p>

<p>"No; certainly not."</p>

<p>"'Cause you can. Give me sixpence, and I'll shew him you, and say
nothin'&#8212;not a word, my lady. Only round here&#8212;'tisn't a minute. I'll
walk first."</p>

<p>Without a thought, I was about to follow the child, when <span
class="smcap">Frederick</span>
coming behind me, laid his hand upon my arm. "<span class="smcap">Lotty</span>,
 my dear," and
without looking at him, I thought I should have dropped at his voice.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Frederick!</span>"</p>

<p>"Not going to have your fortune told?" and he glanced at the gypsey.</p>

<p>"My dear <span class="smcap">Fred</span>, this, you will remember, is
 the child that"&#8212;</p>

<p>"I know," said <span class="smcap">Fred</span>, as the gypsey with a
caper took to her heels. "I
know; but <span class="smcap">Lotty</span>, my love, you have surely
forgotten an old friend? My
bridesman, <span class="smcap">Tom Truepenny</span>."</p>

<p>It was <span class="smcap">Mr. Truepenny</span>. He had come to
Brighton upon business; <span class="smcap">Fred</span> saw
him as he alighted from the coach. "He didn't want to break upon us,"
said <span class="smcap">Fred</span>: "for you know what a shy, modest
fellow <span class="smcap">Tom</span> is; but I said
you'd be delighted to see him."</p>

<p>"Delighted, indeed, <span class="smcap">Fred</span>," said I.</p>

<p>"Delighted, indeed," stammered <span class="smcap">Mr. Truepenny</span>,
 colouring like a girl.</p>

<p>"He has a little business to do, but has promised to join us in the
evening," said <span class="smcap">Fred</span>.</p>

<p>"Oh, certainly, with pleasure&#8212;in the evening," said <span
class="smcap">Truepenny</span>.</p>

<p>"You'll not fail, <span class="smcap">Tom</span>?" cried Fred,
holding up his finger.</p>

<p>"Depend on my punctuality," replied <span class="smcap">Mr. Truepenny</span>.
 And then&#8212;strangely
confused as I thought&#8212;he bowed to me, and hurried off.</p>

<p>"He's an excellent fellow," said <span class="smcap">Fred</span>.</p>

<p>"It was very lucky that you met him, <span class="smcap">Fred</span>,"
 said I.</p>

<p>"<i>Very</i>," answered <span class="smcap">Fred</span>.</p>

<h4>The Irresistibles; or, Horse Guards (Black).</h4>

<p>It is to be hoped that all those cab-drivers who are dissatisfied
with

these fellows would carry everything before them; no troops whatever
could stand their charge.</p>

<h2>WHAT I SAW, HEARD, AND THOUGHT AT CHOBHAM.</h2>

<center>(<i>By one who has mentally been there</i>).</center>

<p>I saw the Light Cavalry so heavily accoutred that it seemed a perfect
farce ever to have ordered them on "active" service.</p>

<p>I saw the Infantry dressed in such torturingly tight coats, that it
appeared a bitter mockery to bid them "stand at ease:" and I thought
that what made them smart on parade must make them anything but smart in
actual service.</p>

<p>I saw the troops generally learning to stand water as well as to
stand
fire: and I thought a drenching shower rather seemed to damp their
military ardour.</p>

<p>I thought that most of the regiments, in attacking a sham enemy,
would
be attacked by a real one in the shape of rheumatism: while many a brave
fellow who never owned to a defeat would return to his quarters
completely weather-beaten.</p>

<p>I heard young <span class="smcap">Ensign Drawlington</span> complain
that it was a "horwid baw fa
fla who's&#8212;aw&#8212;fond of Opwa and Clabs&#8212;and&#8212;aw&#8212;that sorthing, to be
fawced to leave town for this fernal camp affaiaw:" and I thought the
gallant officer would feel considerably more at home in the Theatre of
St. James's than in the Theatre of War.</p>

<p>I saw a force of nearly two dozen policemen sent to keep in order
nearly
ten thousand men: and I thought that the "force" should be rather called
a "weakness" on the part of the Government.</p>

<p>In short, I saw on all sides sufficient ground for thinking that
there
are few finer fields for observation just at present than the field at
Chobham; although, as an area for military man&oelig;uvering, it is not to
be compared with many an area in Knightsbridge.</p>

<h2>WHAT IS A CABMAN'S MILE?</h2>

<a href="images/035.png">
<img src="images/035.png" alt="WHAT IS A CABMAN'S MILE"
width="100%" /></a>
</div>

<p>The question of "What is a Mile?" is likely to take its place by the
side of the important question "What is a Pound?" in the annals of
political&#8212;or some other kind of&#8212;economy. Since the new Act has come
into force&#8212;or rather into operation, for its potency is not yet much
felt&#8212;there has been a fearful conflict of opinion between the
cab-drivers and the public as to what is a mile. It is evident that
there must be an appendix added to all the books on arithmetic, for the
purpose of including Cab Measure, which is quite distinct from any other
measure we have yet met with, and is about as diametrically opposed to
Long Measure, as chalk is to any caseal or curdy compound. In the eyes
of a cabman, "a miss is as good as a mile;" in fact, anything is as good
as a mile for his&#8212;that is to say for his passenger's&#8212;money.</p>

<p>Any one who takes a cab from the West End to go over the water,
whether
by Westminster or Waterloo, may think himself fortunate if he is not
involved in a sort of "Six-Mile-Bridge affair," by the demand of the
cabman for three shillings, as the fare for passing one of the bridges.
We can scarcely wonder at the easy familiarity of a cab-driver; for
there is no one who seems so utterly incapable of keeping his distance.
We trust, however, that the new Act will enable us to have justice
brought to our own door, by handing a cabman at once over to the police,
when a driver gives us a good setting down in a double sense, by
insulting us after taking us to our destination. We may, in fact, now
hope that a cabman's abuse&#8212;as well as his distance&#8212;will have to be
measured.</p><br />

<h2>THE OLDEST CHANCERY SUIT IN THE WORLD.</h2>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/036.png" alt="O" class="cap" width="40%" />

<p class="cap_4">ON many occasions we have heard of the father of the
bar, the father of
the City, and of the father of lies; but a discovery has just been made
of something which may be perhaps likened to the last, in other matters
besides antiquity. We allude to the father of equity, or what we believe
to be the oldest suit in Chancery. This precious relic was dug up a few
days ago, and its tattered remains were exposed for a few minutes to the
air in the Court of <span class="smcap">Vice-Chancellor Kindersley</span>.
 It arose out of a bill
filed nearly a hundred years ago; and we need not say that it must be by
this time a precious old file that keeps the tattered old thing
together. It was a bill to distribute all the property of an old
Scotchman among all his poor relations, and as the Scotch can always
scrape or scratch a relationship with each other, and as the relations
of a Scotchman are certain to be poor enough to want something, the
whole of Scotland may be said to have been more or less interested in
the suit in question. Four hundred and sixty-three persons had already
made out a claim, and the descendants of all these are now contending
with the descendants of another batch of poor Scotchmen with "itching
palms," who have filed bills of reviver for the purpose of galvanising
this spectral old suit, which still haunts, like a ghost, the Courts of
Chancery.</p>
</div>

<p>The Vice-Chancellor made an order for a reviver, "no one appearing to
oppose;" and, indeed, who could have appeared but a few ghosts of dead
legatees to demur to the galvanising of this sepulchral business? We are
satisfied that his Honour, when making the inquiry if "any one appeared
to oppose," must have felt, with a shudder, that he was performing a
species of incantation, and that to call upon any one to "appear" under
such circumstances was almost equivalent to an invocation of <i>Zamiel</i>.
The "suit," however, is to be permitted again to walk the earth for a
time by the agency of a bill of "reviver," and we suppose it will
disappear at the cock crow of the long vacation, to come forth again in
the dark days of term-time during the ensuing November.</p>

<h2>WILD FLOWERS FROM CANADA.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Punch</span> has had much pleasure in
receiving a newspaper from some of
his friends in West Canada. It is called the <i>Hamilton Spectator</i>,
and
<i>Mr. Punch</i> cannot give a higher idea of the excellence of the
journal
than by mentioning that the first article in the number sent him is from
his own pen. So long as the colonists keep such models before them they
may safely be trusted with any amount of "self-government."</p>

<p>He must, however, confess himself rather less pleased with a report
contained in the next page of the <i>Hamilton Spectator</i>. It is an
account
of the latest proceedings in the House of Assembly. The House was in
"Committee of Supply," and salaries, printing expenses, and such matters
were in discussion. The report shall speak for itself.</p>

<blockquote><p>"The next item was £15,094 for expenses at Spencer Wood. <span
 class="smcap">Mr.
Mackenzie</span> objected to it; saying, that he supposed <span
class="smcap">Colonel Prince</span>
would like to treat him as he had once treated the poor prisoners at
Sandwich, who were shot accordingly. But if the Honourable Member
could do so, it would not prevent him from doing his duty to his
country.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Colonel Prince</span> looked on <span
class="smcap">Mr. Mackenzie</span> as a reptile, and trod on
him as such. For the Member for Haldimand to talk of these times,
when he practised rebellion, murder, and mail robbery! It was lucky
for him he (<span class="smcap">Colonel Prince</span>) did not catch
him, for by the Holy
Moses, if he had, the Honourable Member would never have been seen
again on the floor of that House. He wished the Honourable Member
had come over then, and by the Holy Moses he would have speedily
sent him to Heaven. He would have given him a soldier's death, and
have thus saved the country many thousand pounds. The Member for
Haldimand was an itinerant mendicant, who earned a fortune by
sitting in that House and getting a pound a day, because he could
not get a fortune anywhere else. He concluded by assuring the
Honourable Member that, friendly as he was to independence, if he
ever caught him again in the position which he had once been in, he
would hang him.</p>

<p>"The resolution was then carried."</p></blockquote>

<p>Now, this is really rather strong for a Committee of Supply. The
Irish
Members at home are somewhat turgid and blatant; but, except that <span
class="smcap">Mr.
Grattan</span> (the present one, not the clever one, of course) once
intimated
that he should like to have the head of one of the Ministers&#8212;and really
no one wanted a head more than <span class="smcap">Mr. Grattan</span>&#8212;we
 do not think that this
very emphatic style has been introduced into the English legislature.
Imagine <span class="smcap">Mr. Gladstone</span>, on the estimates,
intimating that he should like
to hang <span class="smcap">Sir John Pakington</span>, for objecting to
one of the items, and
enforcing his intimation by an appeal to the "Holy Moses."</p>

<p>On the whole, <i>Mr. Punch</i> is disposed to suggest to his colonial
 friends
(over whose fortunes he watches with the utmost interest) that there is
one species of "self government" to which they seem hardly to have given
sufficient attention. It is personal. Therefore, <i>Mr. Punch</i>, who
is
never personal, will say no more about it.</p>

<h2>GOLD FOUND IN ENGLAND.</h2>

<p>There seems to be at last a prospect of a check being put to the rush
 to
the Diggings by the discovery of gold in England, and, indeed, it stands
to reason that if there is gold at the Antipodes, we have only to dig
deep enough down in order to get to it from this side of the world,
instead of from the other. Supposing that there is abundance of gold in
"the bed of the Turon," we have nothing to do but to get under the bed
here instead of going all the way to Sydney for the purpose of getting
into the bed in question.</p>

<p>A paragraph in the <i>Kent Mail</i> announces the discovery of gold
at
Canterbury in such a decided form, that we hope it may check the insane
emigration of those who are rushing off to Australia to live under
canvas, without any of the comforts or decencies of civilisation, with
the idea that gold, and nothing but gold, constitutes "prosperity." The
following is the paragraph to which we have alluded:&#8212;</p>

<blockquote><p>"<span class="smcap">Canterbury Goldfishings.</span>&#8212;During
 Friday and Saturday last a barber
in the Friar saw something looking much like sovereigns at the
bottom of the river Stow, but thought they were only buttons, and
not worth his trouble to get. He repeatedly counted them, to the
number of 17. Having, however, communicated to others what he had
seen, two young fellows got a boat, and forthwith picked up a
number, which proved to be true and veritable sovereigns. The report
getting afloat, other persons inspected different parts of the
river, and in various places found many more. Altogether above
50<i>l.</i> has been recovered in this way; and at the bottom of
Fortune's Passage, St. Mildred's, a hair watchguard, with two gold
keys and a seal attached, was taken from the river; and at another
spot a portion of a mourning ring was picked up."</p></blockquote>

<p>We may expect, after the publicity we are now giving to this affair,
that the outskirts of Canterbury will soon be turned into a "Canvas
Town," and that there will be an unprecedented demand for fishing-tackle
to supply those who will make a rush to the goldfishings. It will be
observed that the Canterbury gold discoveries are superior in many
respects to the Australian, for while in the latter the precious metal
is in its rough state, the gold found at Canterbury is met with in the
very convenient form of gold keys, seals, and sovereigns.</p>

<p>Some people have been puzzling themselves rather seriously with the
inquiry, how it is that gold has been found in the river Stow?&#8212;but we
have no hesitation in accounting for the fact by stating, that this
wealth must be the result of the washings of the adjacent see, which is
well known to be one of the richest, if not the very richest, in the
whole world. We mean, of course, the See of Canterbury.</p>

<hr />

<h4>A LIKELY JOKE.</h4>

<p>According to the <i>Liverpool Standard</i>, the Irish have been
quarrelling
amongst themselves at Liverpool; but from our contemporary's version of
the affair, we are inclined to doubt this intrinsically very improbable
circumstance. That narrative states that the row apparently originated
as follows:&#8212;</p>

<blockquote><p>"An Orangeman complained that a Papist boy had thrown
some dirt at
him."</p></blockquote>

<p>Orangemen never complain groundlessly of Papist boys, and Papist boys
never throw dirt&#8212;either literally or figuratively. Dirt!&#8212;how are they
to come by it? Who ever saw or smelt any such thing as dirt in any the
most remote connexion with a "Papist boy?"</p>

<hr />

<h4>Changes in the Camp.</h4>

<p>It is found that the late wet weather at Chobham has had a most
singularly contrasting effect upon the potatory propensities of the
officers who have been stationed there. For while the bibulous have been
reduced to most unpalatable tent-and-water, the temperate have been
rarely known to get to bed without a thorough "soaking."</p>

<p class="cap_2">FOR some time past we have seen in the country papers

certain to be introduced at parties, that we cannot say we see the use
of giving them expressly for the purpose of its trial. The motion may in
fact be legally regarded as a "motion of course:" as inseparable from a
party as white kid gloves and flirting. We would simply put it to the
reader, whether, in the whole course of his social experience, he ever
recollects being present at a party where, by the time he went away, his
hat was not "moved" from the peg on which he hung it. For ourselves,
indeed, we may confidently assert that at 99 at least out of a 100
"squeezes" we have attended this season, our hat has been so severely
"operated upon" in our absence from the cloak-room, that we have
scarcely had an inch of brim left us to walk home in. In fact, on more
than one occasion, the operators have so far succeeded in their "moving"
as to have moved it altogether off the premises by the time we wanted
it: but this has only happened, we believe, when by some unlucky
accident we have so far forgot ourselves as to have brought a new one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Advice To Gabbling M.P.'s.</span>&#8212;When you

<h2>WHAT IS THE HOUSE OF KEYS?</h2>

<p>The <i>Court Circular</i> tells us that a deputation from "the House
of Keys"
had an interview with one of the official somebodies or nobodies at
Downing Street the other day, and <span class="smcap">Mr. Wilson</span>,
 M.P., told the House of
Commons the other evening that he had a series of resolutions by "the
House of Keys" in his possession. After some research we find that "the
House of Keys" is something or other in the Isle of Man, answering
probably to the vestry of a parish, the beadledom of an arcade, or some
other small local authority.</p>

<p>We should like to be present at a debate among "the Keys," for we are
curious to know whether they allude to each other as the "Honourable
Member for Street Door," "the Honourable and Learned Member for
Padlock," or "the Gallant and Distinguished representative of
Tea-caddy." We do not quite understand the principle of election that
can prevail in the Isle of Man, if its council consists of nothing but a
bunch of keys; and we are rather puzzled to guess whether the franchise
attaches to persons or things, and whether it would be the door or the
owner of the door, the watch or the owner of the watch, that would send
"a Key" to Parliament. There is one peculiarity of result in having a
House of Keys instead of a House of Commons; for, of course, in an
assembly where the members are all keys they would be unable to deal
with any open question. Perhaps, however, we may have mistaken the sort
of "Keys" of which the "House" in the Isle of Man is composed, and the
members may be mere musical "keys"&#8212;a set of sharps and flats, playing
any tune, just like any other house of representatives. We cannot
conclude without remarking that a very long debate in "the House of
Keys" would remind one of "a lock jaw," though the association is not
agreeable.</p>

<h4>Conjuring at Chobham.</h4>

<p>Alarmists needlessly we are not, and would never prematurely frighten

nation, that on paying a visit to the Camp the other evening, we
discovered that the men were all turned in-to straw!</p>

<h2>A HINT.</h2>

<p>The <i>Times</i> newspaper (a publication of merit, and which may
possibly be
known to some of our readers) has just put forth an excellent article
deprecating the terribly long sittings of the House of Commons, and the
love of chattering, on the part of the Members&#8212;especially the new
ones&#8212;which chiefly conduces to those protracted and unwholesome
<i>séances</i>. But the <i>Times</i> ought to be perfectly well aware
that the
remedy is in its own hands. These objectionable spouters spout, not to
one another (for they ridicule one another's oratory), but to the
readers out of doors. If they could not reach these readers they would
cease to spout. <i>Ergo</i>, if the <i>Times</i> would instruct its
reporters to
report only what is worth reporting, and, in fact, to deal with all
debates as they now deal with those in Committee, when only the pith of
the speeches is given, and moreover the pith of the pithy men only, the
sittings of Parliament would speedily evince a marvellous change for the
better. There! <i>Mr. Punch</i>, in his keen, practical way, has solved
the
difficulty at once.</p>

<hr />

<h4>A Joke at the Public Expense.</h4>

<p>According to a correspondent of the <i>Daily News</i>, <span
class="smcap">Mr. Serjeant Adams</span>,
Assistant Judge of the Middlesex Sessions, is applying to Parliament for
an increase of salary from £1,200 to £1,500. The learned Serjeant is
often facetious; but certainly this is his richest joke.</p>

<h2>ANOTHER INSULT TO IRELAND.</h2>

<p>It is quite proper, but very distressing, that Ireland should know
all
the outrages perpetrated and planned upon her dearest interests. Not a
day can elapse that is not notched, like <span class="smcap">Robinson
Crusoe's</span>, with a new
insult from the Saxon. It ought to have been sufficient that the Camp at
Chobham was commanded in order to destroy the Dublin Exhibition; the
tents being pitched as strongly as possible in outrageous contrast with
<span class="smcap">Dargan's</span> Crystal Palace. But no: a certain
illustrious personage&#8212;with
whom it is notorious the sea does not agree&#8212;in order to frustrate an
intended visit to Dublin, went and caught the measles! Fortunately,
however, he is now convalescent; left without a spot, and consequently
without an excuse.</p>

<hr />

<h4>An Impossible Commissariat.</h4>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Emperor of Russia</span> pretends to say that
 he will provide his troops,
now occupying the Danubian principalities, with rations. How is it
possible that any such promise can be kept by an old despot, who is so
very irration-al?</p>

<hr />

<h4>ANOTHER POTATO BLIGHT FOR "THE KILKENNY CAT."</h4>

<p>The Saxon has again cast his pestiferous blight upon one of Ireland's
chosen potatoes; having withered the patriot <span class="smcap">Murphy</span>
 into an Insolvent
Commissioner!</p>

<p>There is a fine field opened to the editor and contributors of <i>Notes
and
 Queries</i> by the prominence just now being given to the names of
Wallachia and Moldavia. We shall leave Wallachia to our
contemporary&#8212;merely observing by the way that it may have been founded
by the <span class="smcap">Wallack</span> family&#8212;but we have taken a
fancy to Moldavia, and shall
speculate a little on its origin. We are inclined to regard the first
syllable, MOL, as a clear corruption of <span class="smcap">Mary</span>;
 and there can be no doubt,
in the world that davia is no other than <span class="smcap">Davis</span>,
 who was probably some
relation to the identical <span class="smcap">Davis</span>, whose most
unpleasant Straits have
conferred upon him such extensive notoriety. Moldavia may, therefore, be
regarded as the discovery of one <span class="smcap">Mary Davis</span>;
but which one is a little
bit of mystery&#8212;a sort of bone that we generously throw to our old
friend <i>Notes and Queries</i> to "lazily mumble" over during the hot

<h4>A BENEFICE IN THE MARKET.</h4>

<p>In moving, on Wednesday, the second reading of the Simony Law
Amendment
Bill&#8212;deferred, to the delight no doubt of certain prelates, to that day
three months&#8212;<span class="smcap">Viscount Goderich</span> is reported to
 have asked:&#8212;</p>

<blockquote><p>"What was it which the right of presentation conferred?
It was a
right to select a man who, as a Minister of the Church of England,
was to be intrusted with the spiritual affairs of a certain place."</p></blockquote>

<p>Yes, indeed, of a certain place&#8212;and, one would think, when the right
of
presentation is simoniacally purchased, of a certain place (not to be
mentioned to ears polite) where the cure of souls would be a farce.</p>

<hr />

<h4>Strength Apparently Accounted For.</h4>

<p>Notwithstanding the small size of the Aztec children, they are
exceedingly strong. An incurable punster says they doubtlessly derived
this strength from Gymn-aztecs, from whom it probably descended in a
straight line.</p>

<hr />

<h4>HIBERNIAN TACTICS.</h4>

<p>The military ability evinced by the Irish Brigade is of a peculiar
kind.
It is chiefly conspicuous in besieging; for almost the only talent in
the whole party has been displayed in taking places.</p>

Chobham or elsewhere, have more favourable opportunities of attaining
perfection in discipline. The Chamomile Scrubs&#8212;the scene of the
reviews&#8212;are daily thronged with numerous spectators, who, though they
generally arrive when there is nothing to see, and go back again in the
wet, never appear to be disappointed, but, on the contrary, return in
perfect good humour.</p>
</div>

<p>A more than usual number of persons assembled yesterday, in the
expectation of seeing something grand, a rumour having got abroad that
it was the intention of the <span class="smcap">General</span> to call
out the Brook Green Militia
(which distinguished corps, in consequence of the recent augmentation,
now numbers nearly two file and a half), and to brigade them with the
Queen's Piebalds. It was said, too, that the forces thus brought
together would be separated as two divisions, and occupy respectively
the Scrubs and Starch Green, and that a sham fight would take place. But
the idea (if ever entertained) was abandoned&#8212;for what reason we cannot
say, as we do not happen to know&#8212;these things being kept in profound
mystery: but we are informed that a sergeant is under arrest, and will
probably be "smashed" for having said that the ground on Starch Green
was too stiff for the Piebalds. Such an atrocious attempt at a joke will
meet with little sympathy from our readers, and we doubt not the
offender will meet with his deserts, though, after all, perhaps, the
idea <i>was</i> given up on that ground. The Piebalds, having sole
possession
of the Scrubs, went through their evolutions with their accustomed
precision. The "brilliancy" of the movements was somewhat abated in
consequence of <span class="smcap">General Punch</span> having ordered
"field exercise" instead of
"marching order." But those who have any regard for our gallant
defenders will, we are sure, willingly give up "glittering helmets,"
&amp;c., for anything that may conduce to their comfort. We subjoin a
letter
which has come into our hands, which will show that the privates are
subjected to privations and moving accidents in peace as well as war&#8212;in
barracks as well as in the field:&#8212;</p>

<center><i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Lieutenant Whiffin</span>, <i>Royal
 South-South-East-Middlesex Dun Browns</i>.</center>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Whiffin,</span>&#8212;I must tell you how we have
 been going on. Old <span class="smcap">Punch</span> has
been working us up in fine style&#8212;four field days a week, and riding
drill on the off days; besides practising pitching tent in the afternoon
in the barrack yard. However, he is such a jolly old fellow, that we
don't mind a little extra work for him. One thing he has done which we
are particularly thankful for. He lets us go to his reviews in field
exercise instead of marching order.</p>

<p>"Young <span class="smcap">Green</span> of ours says he considers it a
 personal favour. You know he
swapped helmets with <span class="smcap">Captain Wideawake</span> when
he (<span class="smcap">Wideawake</span>) went up to
the <span class="smcap">Duke's</span> funeral, and has never been able
to get his own back since.
<span class="smcap">Wideawake</span> is always 'so busy he can't give it
 him now.' The consequence
is, that W.'s helmet rolls about on <span class="smcap">Green's</span>
head like 'anything,'
especially at a trot, and the scales are so long that he's obliged to
keep his mouth open all the field day to keep it on his head. So that
it's fortunate for him that he's only been a serrefile as yet. If he
were to lead a troop he would have some difficulty in giving the word of
command. Some recruits only recently dismissed have a similar difficulty
to brave.</p>

<p>"I got my troop last Tuesday, which I suppose you saw in the <i>Gazette</i>;
and as the <span class="smcap">General</span> wants the captains to get
up the names of all the men
in the troop, and the number of all the horses, I've got the troop-roll
from Sergeant-Major, and am getting it off by heart. I had a 'law-suit'
the other day. <span class="smcap">Private Grumble</span> reported the
bread, but as he was not
supported by the other men, I put him down easily. The fact is, he's not
much liked by the rest of the men in the troop. He used to be looked up
to as a 'schollard,' but has lost ground lately, owing to a singular
circumstance. A letter appeared in the <i>Ballymucky Reporter</i>,
signed
'<span class="smcap">Miles</span>,' and Sergeant-Major tells me that <span
 class="smcap">Grumble</span> wrote a letter in
reply, and signed himself 'Two <i>miles</i>,' and was informed in the
answers
to correspondents, in the next number, that he was an ass. All the men
saw it, and <span class="smcap">Grumble</span> got laughed at for his
'law.' I am very glad the men
have lost faith in him, as <span class="smcap">Captain Chum</span> told
me he was always boring
about fractions and the price of shaving brushes. As the <span
class="smcap">General</span> wants
us to know all about straps and buckles, and packing valise, &amp;c., I
told
Sergeant-Major I would look at one yesterday. So <span class="smcap">Private
 Muscles</span> was
ordered to show; but as his highlows were at the shoemaker's, and forage
cap at the tailor's, and the rest of the valise was filled with two
sheets and a bolster, I didn't get much information from him. The
Sergeant-Major said I had better order him a week's marching order, and
make him show kit in the afternoon. Which I did, as I thought it better
to do what the Sergeant-Major said. I looked at the kit in the
afternoon. <i>Such</i> a kit, <span class="smcap">Whiffin</span>, you
never saw. The Sergeant-Major
'shook up' everything, and found that the fellow had actually got a wisp
of hay rolled up in a helmet-bag to represent a shirt, and his 'drors,'
as he called them, would, I verily believe, reach from my quarters to
the riding-school. Sergeant-Major says he's always late for morning
stables in winter because his drawers are so full of holes he can't get
into them till a candle is lighted. I hope all this 'private'
information won't bore you, but I have really had no time lately to go
to town and see any of our old haunts. Besides, the <span class="smcap">General</span>
 says we must
take an interest in this sort of thing, in order to study the 'comforts
of the men.'</p>

<p>"Good-bye for the present, old fellow. I shall let you know how we're
getting on from time to time.</p>

<p class="regards">"Yours truly,</p>

<p class="author">"<span class="smcap">John Snaffles</span>, <i>Queen's
Piebalds</i>.</p>

<p>"P.S.&#8212;I've released <span class="smcap">Muscles</span> and given him a
 new kit, on the condition
that he won't get drunk for a month. You know our match with all
Hammersmith comes off in three weeks, and it wouldn't do to have him
away then&#8212;he's a capital long-stop. By the bye, you must contrive to
have a pain in the side, or some urgent business with your legal adviser
about that time, as we can't get any one to bowl in your place.&#8212;J.S."</p>

<h2>THE CABMAN'S BEST FRIEND.</h2>

<p class="salute">"<span class="smcap">Sir,</span></p>

<p>"The Police cases under the New Hackney Carriage Act show that a
determination to struggle against the working of that measure prevails
among the members of my profession, which, though I am a legally
qualified medical practitioner, is at present that of a cabman. For,
Sir, I turned cabman rather than turn quack or sycophant, one of which
things a man must, in general, turn, who has to get his living out of
people most of whom are weakly in mind, body, and sex: particularly in
these days when ladies of rank and Members of Parliament patronise
clairvoyance and hom&oelig;opathy. I may add that I have less driving to do
now than I had when I was in medical practice, and that I get better
paid for it.</p>

<p>"My object in addressing you, is to beg that you will use all your
influence to make the public insist on having the provisions of this
Act, in regard to fares, severely carried out.</p>

<p>"It may be the opinion of insolent <span class="smcap">William</span>,
 and intoxicated <span class="smcap">James</span>, my
brethren of the whip, that in expressing this desire I am merely
uttering the sentiments of a truculent magistrate, or other odious and
tyrannical member of the aristocracy, desirous of interfering between a
poor fellow and the swell out of whom it is his business to get as much
as he can. They may be disposed to invoke dreadful vengeance upon me for
what they consider a sympathy with wealth and respectability, rather
than a fellow feeling with labour and themselves. But, Sir, my beery and
abusive friends are both wrong. I want the Act of Parliament enforced
for the benefit of the people; which is identical with our own.</p>

<p>"The mistake of vituperative <span class="smcap">William</span>, the
error of hiccuping and
unsteady <span class="smcap">James</span>, is the supposition that cabs
were made for none but
extortionate rascals to drive, and none but opulent spendthrifts to ride
in. Nature&#8212;for nature presides even over hired vehicles&#8212;intended cabs
not only for the conveyance of intemperate dandies with cigars in their
mouths, for travellers in hot haste regardless of expense, and reckless
pleasure-hunters dashing away to Cremorne or the Opera. She meant them
also for the accommodation of sober matrons of narrow circumstances and
broad umbrellas, poor clerks, small tradesmen, indigent authors, and
other humble persons pressed for time, troubled with corns, caught in
the rain, or otherwise precluded from pedestrianism. Now, an excessive
legal fare was enough to keep these kinds of people out of cabs; to say
nothing of the certainty of an additional demand, accompanied by insult,
and urged in derisive and revolting language.</p>

<p>"Let it be once understood, on all hands, that the new cab tariff is
to
be a serious reality, a thing as settled as the price of a pot of beer,
and I am sure the increase of practice will more than compensate us for
the diminution of our individual fees. I speak of those who, like
myself, seek an honest livelihood by taking as many cases&#8212;that is,
fares&#8212;as they can, upon reasonable terms, instead of plundering such
patients or victims as they can get hold of to the most villanous
possible extent.</p>

<p>"Pray, therefore, impress upon all friends of the working man, that
working men are to be considered in the light of cab takers as well as
in that of cab drivers. There are some impetuous young blades who are
prone to scatter their cash about on all kinds of cads, amongst whom we
have the honour to rank in their estimation.</p>

<p>"Accordingly they in general overpay us monstrously. Advise them to
discontinue that injudicious liberality; it spoils us: it causes us to
be discontented with full wages, and to laugh in the face of a customer
who proposes to pay us our legal due. It has possessed us with the
notion that everybody who takes a cab is infinitely rich: so that when a
man does not offer us much more than we are entitled to, we are
accustomed to ask him ironically whether he calls himself a gentleman.
Hence it is that we dance, with menacing gestures, around those who
resist our endeavours to cheat them; collect mobs about them; and pursue
them with execrations as far as we dare. A stop will be put to this
state of things by the strict and uniform enforcement of the much-needed
Act which has been passed for the abatement of our knavery and the
prevention of our insolence; I will add, on the whole, for our good: at
least for the good of one member of our body, who is also a Member of
the Royal College of Surgeons, and Licentiate of the Apothecaries
Company, albeit now necessitated to cry</p>

<h2>OUR HONEYMOON.</h2>

<p>SUNDAY, MAY 26, 18&#8212;.</p>

<p>"My dear," said <span class="smcap">Fred</span>, this morning&#8212;"I&#8212;I
don't think I can go to
church. But, of course, <i>you</i> can go, I don't feel like myself this
morning."</p>

<p>"I don't wonder at that, love. Indeed, you don't look yourself. But I
expected as much."&#8212;</p>

<p>"<i>You</i>, <span class="smcap">Lotty</span>!" and <span
class="smcap">Fred</span> opened his eyes.</p>

<p>"Why, I knew what would come of it. Here were you out till twelve
o'clock"&#8212;</p>

<p>"It wanted a quarter," said <span class="smcap">Fred</span>, as if a
quarter could make any
difference.</p>

<p>"Twelve o'clock," said I firmly, "allowing for watches, before you came
home."</p>

<p>"I told you&#8212;I was out talking with <span class="smcap">Tom</span>," and <span class="smcap">Fred</span> tapped the
table.</p>

<p>"Well, if I must say what I think, <span class="smcap">Fred</span>; I don't like <span class="smcap">Mr. Truepenny</span>.
<i>I&#8212;do&#8212;not&#8212;like&#8212;him.</i>"</p>

<p>"I don't wish you to like him, my dear. You're to like and love me; and
to love one man industriously and conscientiously is as much as any
woman can be expected to do. More no reasonable husband can ask of her."</p>

<p>But this I wouldn't seem to listen to. "Twelve o'clock," I repeated.
"Well, what you could find to talk about all that time&#8212;and I
sitting here at the window alone"&#8212;</p>

<p>"You might have gone to bed," said <span class="smcap">Frederick</span>.</p>

<p>"Gone to bed! And <i>you</i> out! Why, what can you think me made of?" But he
only looked at me from under his eyes and laughed. "I'm not a stock or a
stone."</p>

<p>"Certainly not, my darling. I may perhaps be permitted to observe&#8212;in
your own picturesque language&#8212;quite the reverse. <i>Quite</i> the
reverse,"
and he again tapped the table.</p>

<p>"No, love"&#8212;said I; for I thought I'd at once nip <i>that</i> notion
in the
bud&#8212;"of course I don't wish, in fact, I should never think of such a
thing, as to desire to control you in the choice of your friends. If I
don't like <span class="smcap">Mr. Truepenny</span>, why I can't help
it; and there's an end. But
what I wish to say, my love, is this&#8212;oh, it's no laughing matter, for
I'm quite in earnest, I assure you&#8212;if <span class="smcap">Mr. Truepenny</span>
 thinks he's to keep
you out till twelve at night, and I'm to go to bed; if he thinks
<i>that</i>"&#8212;</p>

<p>"But I don't believe"&#8212;said <span class="smcap">Fred</span> coolly&#8212;"he
 thinks anything of the
matter. Indeed, what is it to him whether you never go to bed at all?"</p>

<p>"Of course; nothing. Only I'm not going to sit up and say nothing. A
woman's not to be kept out of her bed as if her soul wasn't her own."&#8212;</p>

<p>"Why, your soul doesn't wear a nightcap, does it?" asked <span
class="smcap">Fred</span>, meaning
to be aggravating.</p>

<p>"I don't know <i>that</i>," said I; for, as I've said, I was
determined to
nip the notion in the bud. "Nevertheless"&#8212;for I wasn't to be put
off&#8212;"what <i>could</i> you talk of till twelve o'clock?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fred</span> said nothing, but looked up at the
ceiling.</p>

<p>"No good, I'm sure," said I in a bit of a passion, and before I knew
it.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Charlotte!</span>" cried <span class="smcap">Frederick</span>,
 and his eyes flashed, as I'd never seen
'em. And then in a moment he looked kind, and I thought sad; and holding
out his hand, he said, looking at me and his eyes softening,&#8212;"<span
class="smcap">Lotty</span>,
love, don't let us quarrel."</p>

<p>My heart was in my throat, and my arm about his neck. "We shall never
quarrel, <span class="smcap">Fred</span>," said I. "But what I meant to
say was&#8212;what an odd person
<span class="smcap">Mr. Truepenny</span> is."</p>

<p>"Odd? A most excellent fellow!" said <span class="smcap">Frederick</span>
 with energy.</p>

<p>"Of course. You wouldn't have any other for a friend: I know that,
love.
But what I mean is, he's so confused&#8212;so bashful."</p>

<p>"Yes. A bachelor's fault. I was so myself once. But it's wonderful
what
confidence marriage gives a man. Kiss me, my darling."</p>

<p>"There, now, <span class="smcap">Fred</span>; it's Sunday," said I,
not knowing what to say. "But
why should <span class="smcap">Mr. Truepenny</span> be in such a twitter
 when he sees me? He
blushes and stammers, and"&#8212;</p>

<p>"It's your beauty, no doubt," said <span class="smcap">Fred</span>.</p>

<p>"Nonsense!"</p>

<p>"A solemn truth. Ah! my dear, it's a great comfort for timid men that
beauty, like the elephant, doesn't know its strength. Otherwise, how it
would trample on us! It's a fact, <span class="smcap">Lotty</span>, if
you had only known half your
power, you'd never have married me. Certainly not. But then women never
do. Looking-glasses are thrown away upon 'em, poor things. When you
consented to take me, <span class="smcap">Lotty</span>, I don't know
that I didn't feel quite
crushed by your condescension. Quite crushed. Yes: the last knowledge a
woman ever acquires is a proper sense of the power of her own beauty.
Otherwise, <span class="smcap">Lotty</span>, they'd never throw it away
upon us; but live and die
like the roses. Don't you think they would? Like the roses?"</p>

<p>I said nothing, but was just gently pulling his ear, when the church
bells struck out.</p>

<p>"If it isn't church-time," said I; "but I'm drest. Nothing, but my
bonnet."</p>

<p>"Well, <span class="smcap">Lotty</span>, you can go without me; yes,
you"&#8212;and then he paused, and
looked at me, I thought so strangely, and said&#8212;"no, my love: you shall
not go alone. We'll go together." With this, he left the room; and a
sudden shadow seemed to fall about me.</p>

<p>The next moment, the servant introduced "<span class="smcap">Mr.
Truepenny</span>." With his face
the truth flashed upon me that&#8212;that&#8212;I didn't know what. But,
instantly, I felt resolved to find it out; and so, in a minute, was in
my very best spirits.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Frederick</span>," said I, "will be here
directly. He's preparing for church."</p>

<p>"Church," said <span class="smcap">Mr. Truepenny</span>, as if the
word half stuck between his
lips.</p>

<p>"Don't you ever go to church, <span class="smcap">Mr. Truepenny</span>?
 I mean"&#8212;</p>

<p>"Always," said he. "But the fact is, when one comes to the sea-side"&#8212;</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Peter's</span> boat," I observed very seriously,
 "was at the sea-side."</p>

<p>"To be sure, certainly," said he; then he looked at the toe of his
boot,
and then at the pattern of the carpet; in fact, anywhere but at me. Then
he coughed, and said&#8212;for all the world as if he was talking of
prawns&#8212;"I'm told there's very good preaching about here."</p>

<p>"I should hope, <span class="smcap">Mr. Truepenny</span>, that there
is good preaching everywhere;
that is, if persons are only disposed to listen to it." <span
class="smcap">Mr.
Truepenny</span>&#8212;his eye still on his boot&#8212;bowed. "I hope," said I, "you
 will
accompany us to church?"</p>

<p>"What! I?" cried the man, really alarmed.</p>

<p>"To be sure: why not?" said <span class="smcap">Fred</span>, coming
into the room. "And then, <span class="smcap">Tom</span>,
we'll take a walk&#8212;<span class="smcap">Lotty</span> isn't equal to the
fatigue"&#8212;how did he know
that?&#8212;"and then we'll all dine, and comfortably close the day
together."</p>

<p>"Well, I&#8212;I&#8212;I've no objection," said <span class="smcap">Mr. Truepenny</span>;
 as though
desperately making up his mind to endure the worst.</p>

<p>"A most admirable preacher, I'm told. Has preached before his
Gracious
Majesty, when Prince Regent," said <span class="smcap">Fred</span>.</p>

<p>"Indeed?" said <span class="smcap">Mr. Truepenny</span>, as if he
wished to be astonished.</p>

<p>"A great favourite at Brighton; he's so extremely mild and well-bred.
Touches upon the pomps and vanities of this wicked world&#8212;and scourges
the miserable sinners who keep carriages&#8212;gently, tenderly. For all the
world as if with a bunch of peacock's feathers you'd dust so many images
of Dresden China."</p>

<p>"That's lucky," said <span class="smcap">Mr. Truepenny</span>.</p>

<p>"<i>Why</i> lucky?" I asked&#8212;for there <i>was</i> something in the
man's manner.</p>

<p>"I meant to say," he stammered, "that there are times when one<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
doesn't
like&#8212;like one's sins to be&#8212;bullied&#8212;that is, not at the sea-side."</p>

<p>"Quite right, <span class="smcap">Tom</span>," said <span
class="smcap">Fred</span>, who I could see was helping him out.
"Very well in one's own parish church, but"&#8212;</p>

<p>"We shall be too late," said I, and I ran from the room; and in a
minute&#8212;never in all my life did I put my bonnet on so quick&#8212;in a
minute I was ready.</p>

<p>The church was extremely full&#8212;as we afterwards found&#8212;for the season.
<span class="smcap">Frederick</span> was particularly serious; and for <span
 class="smcap">Mr. Truepenny</span>, if he'd been
listening to his own condemned sermon, he couldn't have been more
solemn. It was odd, too, I thought, the glances he now and then cast
towards me. And particularly when the clergyman said&#8212;and he seemed, I
really <i>did</i> think for the minute, as though he was looking right
into
our pew, when he said&#8212;"<i>Thou shalt do no murder</i>"&#8212;at the very
words,
<span class="smcap">Mr. Truepenny</span> let his prayer-book slip, and
made such a start to catch
it, that he drew all eyes upon us. I saw <span class="smcap">Frederick</span>
 colour scarlet, and
bite his lips as he glanced at his friend. At last the service was over,
and we got away.</p>

<p>"A very nice sermon," said <span class="smcap">Mr. Truepenny</span>,
trying to say something.</p>

<p>"Very soothing," I added; for I knew he was half-asleep all the time.</p>

<p>"Yes; that's it," said he: "but that's what I like, when I come to a
watering-place. Something quiet, something to think over."</p>

<p>Well we returned to the inn; and somehow we got through the day. I
don't
know how late <span class="smcap">Mr. Truepenny</span> would have sat;
but, for all <span class="smcap">Fred's</span> nods and
winks, I was determined to sit him out. At last,&#8212;it was nearly
twelve&#8212;at last he went away.</p>

<p>"We shall meet in the morning," said <span class="smcap">Fred</span>
to him.</p>

<p>"Of&#8212;of course," said <span class="smcap">Mr. Truepenny</span>; and
then with the awkwardest bow in
the world, he left me and <span class="smcap">Fred</span> together.</p>

<p>"We'd better go to bed," said <span class="smcap">Fred</span>. "Isn't
 it late?"</p>

<p>"Very," said I; "and for my part I thought <span class="smcap">Mr.
Truepenny</span> was never
going."</p>

<p>I went into my room, and&#8212;there upon my table&#8212;was a slip of paper
written in <span class="smcap">Josephine's</span> hand, with these
words:</p>

<p>"<i>If you really love master, you'll not let him get up to-morrow
morning!</i>"</p>

<p>And now all the horror was plain as light! "Get up!" I thought&#8212;and
all
a woman's resolution came upon me&#8212;"only let me once get him well to
bed, and he <i>doesn't get up</i>." I listened for his footsteps. He
came. I
met him with a smile; and <i>didn't I lock the door</i>?</p>

<h2>PEDESTRIANISM AT ST. STEPHEN'S.</h2>

<p>Members of the House of Commons, being in the Library, or elsewhere
about the House, have to run for it in order to be present at divisions,
and are sometimes too late. Lightness of heels (as well as of principle)
appears to be a quality necessary to a representative of the British
people. An election contest might be an actual footrace. Why not? The
candidate that is able to outrun his opponent is at least as fit and
proper a man to represent a constituency, as he is who can outbribe him.
However this may be, we expect soon to see some such arrangements as the
following among the Parliamentary notices:&#8212;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thomas Babington Macaulay</span> will run <span
class="smcap">Joseph Hume</span>, or any other Member, on
the India question; or what not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frederick Lucas</span>, the Scarlet Runner, will
match himself with <span class="smcap">Phinn</span>, the
Bath Brick, to run any length upon the Nunneries' Bill; or as much
farther as the <span class="smcap">Pope</span> chooses.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colonel Sibthorpe</span> will run any Member of <span
 class="smcap">Her Majesty's</span> Government (in
which he has no confidence) at any time, on any question.</p>

<p>We shall also have <span class="smcap">Sir J. T. Tyrrell</span>, the
Farmer's Boy, challenging <span class="smcap">Lord
John Russell</span>, the Bedford Pet, to a trial of speed; the <span
class="smcap">Attorney-General</span>
will be invited to a similar match by <span class="smcap">Sir F.
Thesiger</span>; <span class="smcap">Mr. Bright</span> will
be proposing to hop <span class="smcap">Lord Palmerston</span>; and
perhaps <span class="smcap">Mr. Benjamin Disraeli</span>
will want to jump <span class="smcap">Mr. Gladstone</span> in a budget.</p>

<h4>ST. STEPHEN'S RUBBER.</h4>

<h2>PAX VOBISCUM.</h2>

<p>The Irish constituencies being now completely in the hands of their
spiritual advisers, it is contemplated that henceforth the Speaker's
writ for a new election in Ireland shall be directed to the priests of
the vacant locality. The Reverend gentlemen are to meet (whiskey toddy
and tobacco to be charged to the county), and their endorsement of their
tool's name on the back of the writ, without any other form of election,
is to save all the riot and bloodshed which they now feel it their duty
to their Church and their consciences to cause, if a layman, Catholic or
Protestant, ventures to present himself to the electors without priestly
sanction. Anything for peace and quietness.</p>

<hr />

<h4>HINTS FOR A NEW EDITION OF THE DRAMATISTS.</h4>

<p>We have been favoured with a glimpse of the note-book of a great
dramatic critic, who evidently contemplates giving, or selling to the
world, a great national treat in the form of a new edition of the
dramatists. The annotator seems to combine all the acuteness of the
needle with the straightforward bluntness of the railway buffer. We
subjoin a few specimens:&#8212;</p>

<center>NOTE ON THE TRAGEDY OF DOUGLAS.</center>

<p>There is a passage in this play which has escaped the attention of all
critics who have preceded me; a passage which shows <i>Glenalvon</i> to have
been of a social disposition. In one of the scenes with <i>Norval</i>,
<i>Glenalvon</i> says (<i>aside</i>),</p>

<center>"His port I love."</center>

<p>And, from this remarkable passage, we get three facts: first, that
<i>Glenalvon</i> liked port; secondly, that he had tasted <i>Norval's</i>
 port;
and, thirdly, that the port in question was of a high character.</p>

<center>NOTE ON JULIUS CÆSAR.</center>

<p>The character of <i>Casca</i> has never yet had full justice done to
it by
the critics; but there is one passage which may be compared to a perfect
thoroughfare for finding our way to <i>Casca's</i> real condition. He
evidently belonged to the landlord or agrarian party in the State, and
there can be no doubt that the terms on which his tenants held of him
were exorbitant. The whole fact bursts in upon us like a thunderbolt
through the roof of an out-house, or a broker through the door of an
apartment with the rent in arrear, when we read the following line,
spoken by <i>Antony</i> in the course of his funeral oration over <i>Cæsar</i>:</p>

<center>"See what a rent the envious <i>Casca</i> made!"</center>

<p>Now, this allusion to the rent made by <i>Casca</i> proves either one
 of two
things: First, that he let lodgings at a high price; or, secondly, that
he derived a considerable income from a landed tenantry. I am inclined
to the latter supposition, for it is possible that had he let merely
lodgings, some of the lodgers would have been introduced into the play,
with that nice appreciation of the ludicrous for which <span
class="smcap">Shakspeare</span> is
conspicuous. This not having been done, we are driven on the other
hypothesis, to which, on the whole, we give the preference.</p>

<p>The above specimens will suffice to show the public the addition that
may be shortly expected to a department and style of literature in which
the English language is already rich&#8212;excessively rich&#8212;in the opinion
of some of us.</p>

<hr />

<h4>Philosophy Teaching by Conundrums.</h4>

<p>Why are diplomatic papers called Circular Notes?&#8212;Because they go
round
about a subject without coming to any definite end! They are, moreover,
called Circular because they are seldom on the square.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="smcap">Expensive Spirits.</span>&#8212;The estimates of the
charge of the disembodied
Militia are heavier than one would expect on the supposition that the
Militia, disembodied, consists of the ghosts of Militiamen.</p>

<center><span class="smcap">The Affairs of Turkey.</span>&#8212;The <span
class="smcap">Sultan</span> may "lead a life of jollity:" but his
Minister for Foreign Affairs is <span class="smcap">Redschid</span>.</center><br />

<h2>BRICKS.</h2>

<p>The natural history of Bricks is interesting.</p>

<p>We are enabled to trace it without difficulty from very ancient
periods,
both with reference to its different structures, and with reference to
building purposes.</p>

<p>It is pleasing to observe how the bitumen was first used, how it was
moulded into form, and baked into hardness, by the heat of the Persian
sun. We can trace it through many of its forms until we come to the
great Roman Brick of nine inches long, three inches broad, and three
inches thick. We now discover, with the satisfaction and pleasure of the
antiquarian, how long these Bricks have endured; but, for many years, we
were not aware of any application of the Brick, other than that of
strength, stability, and support of edifices&#8212;edifices which, sometimes,
might really raise the question: "To what extent the architect for
<i>Time</i> meant to contend with <i>Eternity?</i>"</p>

<p>We think we are indebted to our Cambridge friends&#8212;it may be to our
Harrow friends, we cannot tell&#8212;for the first moral or ethical
application of the word Brick.</p>

<p>How common it has been of late years to say to a man, whose virtuous
tendencies are of the first order, "My dear fellow, you are a Brick." It
becomes, however, more emphatic in the usage of the third person. "Do
you know <span class="smcap">Mr. So-and-So</span>? Is he really a man I
can trust? Is he a good
fellow?" The answer in one word is, "He's a Brick." The answer is
satisfactory, in all senses, to the propounder of the question&#8212;indeed,
a more satisfactory reply cannot be uttered.</p>

<p>We have heard this kind of expression called <i>slang</i>&#8212;it really
is not
so. Gentlemen, take up your <i>Plutarch</i>, turn to the Life of <span
class="smcap">Agesilaus</span>,
and what do you read? You'll find, if you understand Greek&#8212;and if you
don't, set about learning it immediately, for the purposes of history,
as well as poetry and elevation of thought&#8212;that when the Ambassador
from Epirus went to <span class="smcap">Agesilaus</span>, to have a
diplomatic chit-chat with him,
he said to him: "Where on earth are the walls of Sparta? In other States
of Greece the principal towns have walls&#8212;but where are yours, dear
<span class="smcap">Agesilaus</span>?" The <span class="smcap">Sir
Stratford Canning</span>, or <span class="smcap">Lord Cowley</span>,
from Epirus, was
answered by that amiable monarch: "I'll to-morrow at morning dawn shew
you the walls of Sparta. Breakfast with me, old chap; some of the best
black soup that Sparta can afford shall be put on the table: and I'll
shew you the walls."</p>

<p>They met: and <span class="smcap">Agesilaus</span> had drawn out his
Spartan army before him, and,
with exulting cheer and dignified mien, said to his friend from Epirus,
"Look! <i>these are the Walls of Sparta, Sir; and every particular man
you
see is a Brick.</i>" How classical becomes the phrase! how distinct from
slang!</p>

<p>We do not say we have translated the great <i>Plutarch</i> literally,
 but we
have translated him in spirit, and if that great man had been now
living, and could have seen this, he would no doubt have been delighted,
and grateful to us for our application of history to the correction of
vulgarisms, and to the promotion of sound and sincere classical
literature.</p>

<hr />

<h4>Slight Mistakes.</h4>

<p>Why is there such a fuss made about the purchase of benefices, the
possession of pluralities, and the management of bishops to get more
income than they ought to have? These are all merely clerical errors.</p>

<h2>SPIRITED CONDUCT OF MR. CHARLES KEAN.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Charles Kean</span> continuing to be exposed
to the nuisance of criticism,
has determined, though with much regret, on a still more decided step in
vindication of his personal dignity than any he has yet taken. Having
already struck off the Free List of the Princess's Theatre all the
critics who have insolently ventured to express unfavourable opinions of
his acting, <span class="smcap">Mr. Kean</span> had hoped that the
public would have taken this
warning that he is not amenable to hostile criticism. In this hope he
regrets to find himself disappointed. Many persons still consider him a
bad actor, and have not shrunk from audaciously expressing this
detestable opinion in and out of the Princess's Theatre. Further
forbearance on <span class="smcap">Mr. Kean's</span> part would clearly
be an act of injustice to
himself.</p>

<p>He has, therefore (though at cost of much pain to himself), resolved
on
a measure which he trusts will prevent any repetition of this annoyance.
<span class="smcap">Mr. Kean</span> deeply regrets that <span
class="smcap">Her Majesty</span>, having lately visited the
Haymarket Theatre, was observed (no doubt, in an unguarded moment,) to
laugh at <span class="smcap">Mr. Braid's</span> offensive (and most
unsuccessful) imitation of <span class="smcap">Mr.
Kean's</span> performance in the <i>Corsican Brothers</i>, which <span
class="smcap">Mr. Buckstone</span> has
had the bad taste to sanction in a ridiculous and entirely unsuccessful
burlesque or extravaganza, called the <i>Ascent of Mount Parnassus</i>.
This
having been brought to <span class="smcap">Mr. Kean's</span> ears (as
most acts of the same kind
are sure to be), he has, in consequence, struck <span class="smcap">Her
Majesty's</span> name off
the Free List of the Princess's Theatre, exclaiming, in the manner of
<i>Richard</i>, and in a tone of dignity which so over-powered the
prompter
and stage-manager that he has not yet recovered the shock&#8212;</p>

<center>"Off with her name! so much for Royalty!"</center><br />

<h2>THE GREAT CHOBHAM CAMPAIGN.</h2>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/048.png" alt="W" class="cap" width="30%" />

<p class="cap_3">WE learn with pleasure that the gallant fellows
assembled under canvas
at Chobham have proved that they can not only stand fire, but they can
stand water with astonishing bravery. No soldiers have ever gone so far
"into the bowels of the land" as these highlowed heroes, who have
stamped the imprint of their military heels on the mud of Chobham. Never
were laurels so thoroughly watered as the laurels worn at Chobham, by
what Cockneyism would call indiscriminately the veterans and the
wetter-uns of our encamped soldiery. If any man lately under canvas has
had a stain to get rid of, we may be sure that it has been thoroughly
washed out by the showers with which he has been saturated. The only
wonder is that the gallant fellows have not been all washed away by a
mode of "hero wash-up" that would have been indeed deplorable.</p>
</div>

<hr />

<h2>THE LAST OF THE PAUPERS.</h2>

<p>A pauper is generally imagined by foreigners to be a lantern-jawed,
herring-paunched, emaciated and pallid wretch, cropped and shaven,
clothed in pepper-and-salt ditto, and employed in crushing bones for
manure and soup. Thanks to Free Trade and the Diggings&#8212;among second
causes&#8212;this order of fellow Christians is now almost extinct. Our
continental neighbours will find, on inquiry, that a wholly different
appearance is for the most part presented by the remaining objects of
British charity. Coats, waistcoats, and trousers&#8212;in some cases gaiters
and breeches&#8212;of superfine black cloth, warm and comfortable to the
feeling, sleek and glossy to the sight, envelope with liberal amplitude
proportions which are plump, and perhaps corpulent. The nether
extremities are encased in capacious and shiny highlows, sometimes
silver-buckled. A goodly beaver hat with extensive brim shades the
entire man from the rays which tend to liquefy the oleaginous part of
him. This is the only badge of poverty that he bears about him; its form
is suggestive of an emblem of manual labour&#8212;the Shovel.</p>

<p>His dietary is open to no objection in regard either to quantity or
quality; except that, in both respects, it tends rather to produce
plethora and engender gout. It is, in fact, discretional; for even when
he enjoys an indoor maintenance, he receives a stipend in lieu of
rations, and this sum is usually handsome enough to enable him to
indulge in every delicacy of every season.</p>

<p>When he thus lives in the House&#8212;the Almshouse provided for him&#8212;he has
the whole of it to himself, and is required to share it with nobody
except his own family if he is blessed with one: so far, therefore, from
being separated from his wife in a comfortless ward, he occupies a
mansion which is the abode of domestic happiness.</p>

<p>His work is mostly as optional, conversely, as his victuals: so that
he
can eat and drink as much, and exert himself as little as he likes. The
only employment obligatory upon him is light clerical duty, and the
greater part of that he is permitted to delegate to somebody else. He is
supposed, indeed, to be continually producing new editions of Greek
Testament, biblical or patristic commentaries, confutations of Popery,
apologies for Church-rates, and other works tending to the spiritual
welfare of the nation; to the due performance of which tasks a necessary
condition is learned leisure, accompanied by nutritious food and
generous liquor.</p>

<p>This walking monument of beneficence&#8212;walking when he does not ride in
 a
well-appointed carriage&#8212;is almost the only eleemosynary kind of person,
except the actual mendicant, existing among <span class="smcap">Her
Majesty's</span> subjects. The
funds which serve for the maintenance of the order of industrious
poverty to which this useful member of society belongs, are derived from
freehold and personal property together with rent-charges on land,
amounting on the whole to £50,000,000. That all this property was
granted by our ancestors for charitable purposes&#8212;to wit hospitals and
schools&#8212;attests their munificence; whilst how prosperous we are is
evident from the fact, that in order to use up all their bounty, we roll
several hundred paupers into one.</p>

<hr />

<h4>The Heroes of a Hundred Showers.</h4>

<p>The Clerk of the Weather ought certainly to be called to account for
his
treatment of our gallant soldiers at Chobham, who have been literally in
"soak" during nearly the whole of the present campaign. The incessant
wet is, in fact, a reflection upon the courage of the military, for we
may well ask if they are subjected to weather that is always foul on the
principle, that "none but the brave deserve the fair."</p>

<h2>GREAT JEW MEETING.</h2>

<p>On Saturday evening last, a large and influential meeting of members
of
the Hebrew nation assembled in the Synagogue, Great Saint Helen's, for
the purpose of taking into consideration the recent article in <i>Punch</i>,
in which that illustrious individual, remarking upon the fact that Jews
were somehow or other mixed up in most cases of fraud, chicanery and
imposture, strongly counselled the respectable and wealthy portion of
the community to take such measures, as might tend to destroy an
argument especially useful to those whose bigotry resisted the admission
of the Jew Englishman to the civil rights of a Christian Englishman.</p>

<p>Among those who were present we noticed <span class="smcap">Baron
Ingots</span>, <span class="smcap">Sir Aaron
Montechristo</span>, <span class="smcap">Mr. Alderman Fitzdavid</span>,
the <span class="smcap">Rev. Rabbi Haphtorah</span>,
<span class="smcap">Professors Bereshith</span> and <span class="smcap">Bara</span>,
 and others, as representatives of the
higher classes; and <span class="smcap">Messrs. Abrahams</span>, <span
class="smcap">Isaacs</span>, <span class="smcap">Jacobs</span>, <span
class="smcap">Ikey</span>, <span class="smcap">Barney</span>, <span
class="smcap">Clo</span>,
<span class="smcap">O. Clo</span>, <span class="smcap">Behemoth</span>, <span
 class="smcap">Gonoff</span>, <span class="smcap">Shobbus</span>, <span
class="smcap">Fence</span>, <span class="smcap">Sheeney</span>, <span
class="smcap">Tango</span>, &amp;c. &amp;c. on the
other interest. The former class had not deemed it desirable to bring
the ladies of their families, but in the body of the meeting we remarked
<span class="smcap">Mrs.</span> and <span class="smcap">Miss Ikey</span>,
 <span class="smcap">Mrs. Behemoth</span>, <span class="smcap">Mrs.</span>
 and the <span class="smcap">Misses Shobbus</span> (11),
<span class="smcap">Mrs.</span> and <span class="smcap">Miss Sharon</span>,
 <span class="smcap">Mrs. Tusks</span>, and other distinguished Mosaic
ornaments of private life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Alderman Fitzdavid</span> was voted into the
chair, and a disposition to
disturbance among the less select part of the meeting was speedily
suppressed by the worthy Alderman reminding them, in a firm but
good-humoured tone, that "he happened to be a magistrate." A young
gentleman in the crowd appeared to take this remark as personal, and
left the meeting somewhat abruptly, immediately after which it was
noticed that <span class="smcap">Mrs. Sharon</span> was compelled to
borrow her daughter's
pocket-handkerchief.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Alderman Fitzdavid</span> then read the
article from <i>Punch</i>, and said that
the Hebrews were deeply indebted to that periodical. It had never shrunk
from fighting their battles, or from pointing out their errors, and he
was convinced that no right-minded Jew could mistake <i>Mr. Punch's</i>
meaning or mistrust his goodwill. There was no doubt that the great mass
of the Jews in England worshipped gold with a devotion which made them
blind to better things.</p>

<p><i>A Voice.</i> Vot's better, my dear, ceptin' dimonds; eh, vot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Alderman Fitzdavid</span> would tell them.
Honesty was better, and
straightforward dealing, and liberality. Why had the word Jew become
synonymous&#8212;</p>

<p><i>A Voice.</i> Eh? vot. There's a proud vord. Dictionary, s'elp me!
Aint he
ambitious? Synonnymouth! Lor!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Alderman Fitzdavid.</span> Synonymous with&#8212;he
 would not say cheat, but
with a sharp practitioner, in the mouths of their Christian
fellow-subjects?</p>

<p><i>A Voice.</i> All prejudith, my dear; all blinded prejudith,
whereof it
behoves them to be ashamed. (The speaker was here removed by Policeman C
146, in order to an arbitration in regard to a gold snuff-box just
annexed by the former.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baron Ingots</span> said that he was urgent to
remove this reproach from
Israel. He looked to education as the remedy, but then the Jews had
already ample provision of well-conducted schools. There was something
wanting besides mere book-learning.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Rev. Rabbi Haphtorah</span> would not preach
to them, but he, in common
with all who endeavoured to do good by instruction, felt painfully that
the spirit of modern Jewism counteracted the effect of the noble Hebrew
rules of life. What was the use of his proclaiming "Covet not," when the
lesson of every day was "Covet everything, and get as much of it as you
can."</p>

<p><i>A Voice.</i> The Christians as talks is so much better, isn't
them?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir A. Montechristo.</span> That was no answer.
Besides he was bound to admit
that there was a large portion, though only a portion, of the
Christians, who did look to better things than mere gain. It was a
disgrace to the English Jews, considering their limited number and great
advantages, that they did not present a practical refutation of the
charges of their enemies.</p>

<p><i>A Voice.</i> Hear him! Vy, he could buy up streets full of
Christians as
easy as I'd buy a net of oranges. (<i>Blandly.</i>) D'ye happen to vant
any
fine oranges, <span class="smcap">Sir Hairon</span>? Proud to vait upon
yer at yer ouse&#8212;knows it
vell. Not a Lord in the land&#8212;not the <span class="smcap">Dukey
Vellintons</span> himself has got a
finer. Now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor Bereshith</span> dwelt with much
earnestness upon the contemptible
character of the greedy and avaricious man, and upon his inevitably low
station in the scale of society; but his speech was interrupted by <span
 class="smcap">Mrs.
Behemoth</span>, who insisted on forcing her way to the chairman, in
order to
get him to buy a ring which had come into<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
her hands rather
promiscuous, and was just fit for his finger. The horrible clamour which
the energetic matron made, on being put forth from the meeting, tended
to bring matters to a conclusion. Other speeches were delivered, in
which the Hebrew gentlemen expressed their sincere desire to improve the
condition of their humbler brethren, but the latter did not seem very
grateful or much inclined to co-operate. A resolution of thanks to
<i>Punch</i>, and of hope that he would continue his exertions for and
among
the Jews was carried, and the meeting was broken up.</p>

<hr />

<h2>A WASTE OF SYMPATHY.</h2>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/050.png" alt="P" class="cap" width="25%" />

<p class="cap_3">PUNCH has seen that much generous sympathy has been
excited for an
unfortunate Cab-driver, "said" to have been sent to prison for a month
for the offence of not having five shillings in his pocket. One story is
good till another is told; but unfortunately the police reporters tell
so many stories, that it is almost impossible to keep pace with them.
After several columns of indignation&#8212;more or less virtuous; after the
expenditure of a rivulet of ink, having more than the usual quantity of
gall in it; and after a little energetic questioning in the House of
Commons, the plain truth comes out that the Cab-driver never said a word
about "not having five shillings," and consequently was not sent to
prison at all for his poverty, but because he was convicted of an
overcharge, and because he declined the test of actual measurement which
was offered to him.</p>
</div>

<p>We make every allowance for a reporter whose province it may be to
exaggerate gooseberries, and give undue enormity to cauliflowers for
paragraphical purposes, but it is rather too hard of him to indulge his
imagination and allow it to run riot in getting up a monstrous case of
magisterial oppression. The affair has, perhaps, answered its purpose,
for it has given gigantic dimensions to a police report and made that
productive of half-a-crown which would, if kept within the commonplace
limits of fact, have yielded scarcely a shilling; it has given an
opportunity to "able editors" to write admirable leading
articles&#8212;admirable in every respect but the foundation, which has
unfortunately given way; and it has permitted vigilant Members of
Parliament to show their vigilance, by asking the Home Secretary what he
is about, and why he doesn't reverse a few magisterial decisions every
now and then, by way of keeping up the "independence" of the Bench and
showing that he is not asleep in his office. So far as any good may
result from these things, the fictitious report of the Cab case has
answered its purpose; but the only real advantage we can see in it has
been gained by the Cabman, for whom subscriptions have poured in which
have enabled him to pay his fine, and perhaps leave him a handsome
balance for future penalties. Whilst we firmly oppose the Cabman in all
his delinquencies&#8212;and they are not a few&#8212;let him only come forward
with a real wrong, and he shall have all the benefit of <i>Punch's</i>
avenging <i>bâton</i>.</p>

<h2>MARTIN IN JACK'S GOWN; OR, <i>MAWWORM</i> WELL ACTED.</h2>

<p>There is no kind of man more delightful to meet with than a good
clergyman who is also a good fellow, and, moreover,&#8212;within canonical
and decent limits&#8212;a wag. Now, here is one such singularly pleasant
parson, writing, as a correspondent of the <i>Times</i>, thus:&#8212;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Sir,&#8212;My attention has just been directed to an
Advertisement in
the <i>Times</i> of the 11th instant, inserted by the Great Western
Railway Company, announcing an excursion train for Sunday, the 17th
instant, to Oxford, Banbury, Leamington, Warwick, and concluding by
saying, that 'the Warwick station is only a short distance from the
romantic ruins of Kenilworth Castle.'</p>

<p>"This last sentence is probably only added as a bait to catch
excursionists. It is well, therefore, that such and the public in
general should know that&#8212;thanks to the excellent proprietor, the
<span class="smcap">Earl of Clarendon</span>&#8212;'the romantic ruins of
Kenilworth Castle' are not
open to visitors on the Sabbath&#8212;an arrangement, I may add, which
has added much to the morality and proper observance of the Lord's
Day in our parish.</p></blockquote>

<p class="regards">"I remain, your obedient Servant,</p>

<p class="author">"<span class="smcap">Edward R. Eardley Wilmot,</span><br />

Vicar of Kenilworth."</p>

<p>"<i>Vicarage, Kenilworth, July 18.</i>"</p><br />

<p>This is no judaising Puritan, this <span class="smcap">Mr. Wilmot</span>.
 This is no semi-Christian
pharisee, substituting for the broad phylactery the extensive white
choker highly starched; no fanatical sort of hybrid or mule, taking most
after donkey. No; our Reverend gentleman is a genial, kindly priest,
with a turn for playful irony&#8212;in the spirit whereof he writes to the
<i>Times</i>. He knows well enough&#8212;bless him!&#8212;that the liberal <span
class="smcap">Earl of
Clarendon</span> would never have shut up "Kenilworth Castle" against
the busy
people, on the only day when there would be any use in opening it to
them. He, to be sure, is aware that the ungracious deed has been
perpetrated by some underling; some sanctimonious <span class="smcap">Barebones</span>
 of a
steward, or some methodistical old housekeeper, to whom the "bitter
observance of the Sabbath" is sweeter than fees. Indeed, his use of the
Jewish word Sabbath, in this connexion, for the day which he calls below
by its Christian name, allows his real feeling as regards the matter to
transpire. In feigning to thank the excellent <span class="smcap">Earl
of Clarendon</span> for a
miserable act of bigotry, he takes a funny way of letting the noble <span
 class="smcap">Earl</span>
know what a sectarian ass some one of his servants has been making
himself in the name, and at the expense, of the reputation of his
Lordship.</p>

<p>The conclusion of our Reverend humourist's epistle is capital. No
doubt
such an arrangement as that of shutting up "a romantic ruin," a scene of
picturesque and venerable beauty, replete with historical associations
of famous memory, suggestive of lofty and solemn thought: no doubt the
arrangement of closing such an objectionable place as this on the
Sunday, must have "added much to the morality and proper observance" of
that day in the parish, by tending considerably to increase the
congregation at&#8212;the public-house.</p>

<h2>CURE FOR THE CONSCIENCE MONEY MANIA.</h2>

<p>Really the Conscience Money Mania is becoming quite a nuisance. Every
day, almost, the <i>Times</i> contains some such announcement as this:&#8212;</p>

<blockquote><p>"The <span class="smcap">Chancellor of the Exchequer</span>
 acknowledges the receipt of
half-notes value £15, for unpaid Income Tax."</p></blockquote>

<p>A good healthy conscience is the noblest point in the character of
that
noblest work of creation&#8212;an honest man. But a diseased conscience is as
bad as a rotten potato; it is worse than no conscience at all: some
degrees below mere dishonesty. This kind of conscience makes people pay
omitted Income Tax. They shouldn't do so. It is really quite immoral.
The Income Tax is acknowledged to be an imposition by <span
class="smcap">Gladstone</span> himself,
insomuch that he has even made arrangements for its cessation. That it
never will cease, however; that it will be as perennial as evil in the
abstract, or the Deuce himself, is feared by everybody except the jolly
beggars, and those who are too ignorant and helpless, or too lazy, to
earn liability to its infliction. Any symptoms of acquiescence in it, of
anything but dogged opposition to it, on the part of the public, will
infallibly encourage Chancellors of the Exchequer to try and perpetuate
it. To pay it voluntarily, to pay it at all except under protest, to pay
it under any circumstances whatever but those of legal necessity, is to
give Chancellors of the Exchequer that encouragement: much more to pay
it in a conspicuous and ostentatious manner, at beat of drum, so to
speak, as the gentleman settles his just accounts in <i>A New Way to Pay
Old Debts</i>. And this is encouraging the <span class="smcap">Chancellor
 of the Exchequer</span> to
go on cheating the nation, or rather cheating part of the nation, in
order to bribe the rest. It is being an accessory to the confiscation of
one's own property; to defrauding one's self: whereas, surely, if
suicide is the worst kind of murder, self-cozenage is the vilest sort of
roguery. Therefore, we argue that the conscientiousness that pays
conscience money on account of Income Tax is, as aforesaid, morbid; a
diseased bump, in phrenological language, which ought to be shaved, and
have ice put to it, or leeches, or cupping glasses after scarification,
to be followed by a blister: recourse to these antiphlogistic measures
being combined with alterative and cooling medicines.</p>

<h4>LOGIC FOR MR. LUCAS.</h4>

<p>Nuns are, for the most part, ladies of extreme sanctity and purity
who
educate large numbers of children, and do a great deal of good to the
poor.</p>

<p>Therefore, to institute any inquiry as to their liability, under
existing circumstances, to compulsory detention in their convents, to
cruel punishments under the name of penance, to coercion in regard to
the assignment of their property, or any other species of constraint,
ill-usage, or duresse, at the hands of malicious, fanatical, or
unscrupulous superiors, and ecclesiastical governors, is unnecessary and
inexpedient.</p>

<h2>OUR HONEYMOON.</h2>

<p>MONDAY, MAY 27, 18&#8212;</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Tom's</span> a good fellow,"&#8212;said <span
class="smcap">Frederick</span>, when he got to bed.</p>

<p>"I don't want to hear anything of <span class="smcap">Tom</span>
now," said I; for suddenly I felt
as if I could have&#8212;well, I don't know what; but I <i>did</i> for the
minute
almost hate the man.</p>

<p>"He goes very early to-morrow. By the first coach, love. I've
promised
to see him off."</p>

<p>"How very kind of you, <span class="smcap">Fred</span>;" and I could
almost have cried, he seemed
as if it was so easy for him to try to deceive me. "Going to see him
off? Then&#8212;for it's very late; for my part, I thought the man would
never go&#8212;then you'd better go to sleep, <span class="smcap">Fred</span>;
 that you may be up.
Otherwise you'll be very tired, dear; very tired."</p>

<p>"Think so?" said <span class="smcap">Fred</span>, trying to be cool:
for I knew it was only trying.
"Think so?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure so," said I, worried and restless and vexed: not that I
stirred.</p>

<p>"Well, then, love, good night," said <span class="smcap">Fred</span>.</p>

<p>"Good night," said I, very short; though I felt as if my heart would
break.</p>

<p>I lay and listened, with the door-key under my pillow; and my pillow
well under my shoulders. That key I was determined should never leave
me: I'd make sure of <i>that</i>, and I grasped it to be certain it was
there. Then I listened again. He was not asleep; I was sure of that;
though he lay as still as any baby, and tried to seem asleep. Very well,
thought I; very well; you shall not outwake me: no&#8212;I'll watch like any
owl. At least like any guardian spirit.</p>

<p>And to think that <span class="smcap">Fred</span>&#8212;my own <span
class="smcap">Frederick</span>, with one heart between us, as
he's so often said&#8212;could lie there; yes, by my very side, and have a
secret and keep it from me&#8212;well, I did begin to think that dear Mamma
was right; and I've heard her say she'd never trust dear Papa further
than she could see him&#8212;not always that.</p>

<p>At last he slept.&#8212;No; he didn't. Well, I never thought he could have
such art. But perhaps he suspected my thoughts; imagined I was watching
him! When this entered my head, I determined to affect sleep myself; and
so see which of us could do it the best.</p>

<p>So I settled myself and&#8212;again being sure of the key; yes, there it
was&#8212;safe enough&#8212;and began to appear to go to sleep. In a little while,
I had so beautifully deceived him that he was fast&#8212;fast as a church.</p>

<p>&#8212;It couldn't have been above five minutes, but I had dozed off; and
woke with such a start!&#8212;Almost instinctively I placed my hand under the
pillow; the key was safe.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, <span class="smcap">Lotty</span>? Dreaming?"&#8212;said
 <span class="smcap">Fred</span>; for I had either
awakened him, or he was awake all the time. "What's it about?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Nothing in particular," said I, "good night, love; or you'll be too
late for <span class="smcap">Mr. Truepenny</span>."</p>

<p>At the word, I thought I heard <span class="smcap">Fred</span>
sigh&#8212;just gently sigh&#8212;and the
sound went like a dagger through me!</p>

<p>And then what a dream I'd had: and it couldn't have lasted above
three&#8212;certainly not five&#8212;minutes! What a dream! Such a confusion of
things! I thought I still grasped the key, and it turned in my hand to a
pistol! And then I thought I dropt it on the ground, and it went hopping
along like a grasshopper, popping and going off as it went. Then I
thought I was resolved <span class="smcap">Fred</span> should not get up
 and go out&#8212;and then I
suddenly found myself tying the sleeves of his shirt in double-knots,
and then emptying the water-jug into both his boots! Then I thought I
went through a churchyard, and saw that odious <span class="smcap">Truepenny</span>&#8212;drest
 like a
pantomime clown&#8212;digging a grave; and as he dug it, singing a song about
spades being trumps. Then I thought <span class="smcap">Fred</span> was
suddenly by my side, and
that dreadful <span class="smcap">Truepenny</span> took up a shovelful
of earth, and was about to
throw it, with a laugh, in the face of <span class="smcap">Fred</span>,
when I&#8212;I tried to scream,
or <i>did</i> scream, and awoke!</p>

<p>Oh! how I did wish we were well at home! And how I did lie&#8212;lie upon
thorns and listen for him to go well to sleep, that I might creep out
and learn everything of <span class="smcap">Josephine</span>. And how I
blamed myself that, before
I came to bed, I didn't go and hear all she had to say!&#8212;But then I was
in such a hurry to have <span class="smcap">Fred</span> all safe, and
the key in my own
possession&#8212;safe under my pillow&#8212;and I thought he would so soon go to
sleep, and he hadn't! Which made it plain to me that he had something on
his mind: and that something&#8212;oh, how I did abominate that <span
class="smcap">Mr.
Truepenny</span>. No; I thought to myself&#8212;as I lay awake, waiting for <span
 class="smcap">Fred</span> to
go off, that is, if he was going to sleep at<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span> all&#8212;no: <span
class="smcap">Mr. Truepenny</span>:
you never enter my house. You never cross the threshold of the Flitch. A
pretty friend indeed to take a man out&#8212;and that man newly married&#8212;to
be shot like a sheep; and to leave a lonely, unprotected,
broken-hearted&#8212;</p>

<p>The bitter thought was too much for me, I wept in good earnest; but
cried so quietly&#8212;I was almost choked&#8212;for fear <span class="smcap">Fred</span>,
 for he was <i>not</i>
asleep, should hear me! Oh, and again and again I thought, if ever we
<i>do</i> get home! What a home I'll make it! And still&#8212;and I was sure
of
it&#8212;still he was awake.</p>

<p>And then I thought, suppose he should not go to sleep at all. Suppose
 he
should get up and&#8212;well, no matter; I was resolved: I'd get up with him.
I'd go with him. I'd cling to him. I'd never leave him. I'd call
assistance, constables&#8212;</p>

<p>And now it was broad daylight, and&#8212;yes, surely, he <i>was</i> asleep?
 I
listened; and I couldn't be mistaken: no, I was sure he slept. And then
I rose gently&#8212;very, very gently to look, and&#8212;yes,&#8212;he was in a deep
sleep. His face&#8212;that beautiful face&#8212;was white, white and hushed and
still as marble! Oh, how much I seemed to learn&#8212;how much more to live
in that minute&#8212;looking, looking&#8212;and he&#8212;all the time as if there was
some dreadful story under that deep stillness!</p>

<p>I rose quietly as possible; hardly breathing. But still he slept&#8212;I
was
sure of that. I took the key from under my pillow. Oh, that dreadful
lock! It was old and rusty, and began to creak and squeak; and I holding
my breath, and almost standing upon my tiptoes trying to turn the key.
At last, with a grating noise the lock turned. I passed&#8212;he was still
asleep. I opened the door; and was about to pass to <span class="smcap">Josephine's</span>,
 when
something whispered me, lock the door again. I did so; for I couldn't be
too sure. So I locked the door&#8212;that casket-door, as I thought&#8212;for <span
class="smcap">Fred</span>
lay sleeping.</p>

<p>Fortunately, <span class="smcap">Josephine's</span> door was
unlocked; though&#8212;I had not time to
speak of it at the moment, not but that the thought struck me at the
very instant&#8212;though how a young woman could go to bed without
double-locking her door I couldn't understand, although on second
thoughts perhaps she had left it open for me&#8212;and <span class="smcap">Josephine</span>
 fast asleep.
Fast! in fact, as I said, anybody&#8212;that is, any robber&#8212;might have come
in and stripped everything, and she been none the wiser. At last, by
nudging and shaking I woke her.</p>

<p>"Murder!" she half-cried; but I put my hand before her mouth.</p>

<p>"Silence! you foolish creature! You needn't cry out so! It's only"&#8212;</p>

<p>"La!" said the girl; "I was dreaming; and you did a little startle
me. I
thought it was true."</p>

<p>"Now, <span class="smcap">Josephine</span>! what is it? I mean about
your master"&#8212;</p>

<p>"It wasn't him I was dreaming on, Ma'am," cried the creature.</p>

<p>"I should think not, indeed," said I. "Dream of your master! Like
your
impudence! But what I want to know is&#8212;all, all you know."</p>

<p>"La! Ma'am!" cried the stupid girl, rubbing her eyes, and yawning
frightfully.</p>

<p>"I mean that note you left on my dressing-table!"</p>

<p>"Oh!" she exclaimed, as though at last she was thoroughly awake. "Oh,
ma'am, be sure you don't let master get up. Put your arms round his
neck, if you almost choke him&#8212;but don't let him get up."</p>

<p>"Why not?" I cried.</p>

<p>"He's going to fight; with pistols. One of&#8212;that is, I've been told
all
about it; but not time enough to tell you. Master would have fought
yesterday, only it was Sunday, so he went to church instead. <span
class="smcap">Mr.
Truepenny</span> has come, like a friend, all the way from London, to
see fair
play; but don't you let him get up, Ma'am, pray don't"&#8212;</p>

<p>"Fight! And with whom?"</p>

<p>"Don't know exactly, Ma'am; but that doesn't matter. One may be as
bad
as another. But you're sure master's safe, for he was to go out early,
as I heard?"</p>

<p>"I've locked the door; and he shall not stir. If he attempts it, I'll
raise the house!" said I.</p>

<p>"Do, Ma'am," cried <span class="smcap">Josephine</span>, "and I'll
help you."</p>

<p>I returned to my apartment with new resolution. I unlocked the door;
crept into the room, and without looking again locked it; taking out the
key, and hugging it close. I stept softly towards the bed. <span
class="smcap">Frederick</span> was
not there! I looked round&#8212;the sash was raised. He had escaped through
the window.</p>

<p>All I know is, I gave a shriek and fell fainting upon the bed!</p>

<h2>THE WOMAN'S ELEVATION LEAGUE.</h2>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/053.png" alt="T" class="cap" width="30%" />

<p class="cap_3">THE March of Intellect will eventually stride onwards
in "seven-leagued
boots," for there is every now and then some new league claiming to give
a forward impetus to humanity. The last new league is calculated to
carry us many miles in advance of everything we have yet approached, for
it is no other than a "Woman's Elevation League." Every league of this
description contains several acres&#8212;commonly called wise-acres&#8212;and
though no names are given in the "prospectus," we dare say we should
meet with several "old familiar faces," if we could fall in with the
committee, and that we should recognise among the members not a few of
those professed friends of "progress," who are always making a hash of
something or other, and eventually falling out among themselves in the
name of "universal harmony." The "Woman's Elevation League" professes of
course to give Woman a tremendous hoist in one shape or another. We
confess that our own ideas of the Elevation of Woman are not
particularly definite, but are divided between <span class="smcap">Madame
 Poitevin</span> in a
balloon, and <span class="smcap">Mademoiselle Gellini</span> making her
"terrific ascent" at
Cremorne to the top of a pasteboard tower amidst a "brilliant display of
fireworks." Possibly this is not the sort of "elevation" contemplated by
the "league" in question for the female sex, though it is evidently
designed to place Woman occasionally at the top of a poll; for it is
contemplated that she shall take her seat in Parliament. We have been in
the habit of thinking that women are very well as they are, but the
"League" is desirous of making her a doctor, a trader, an artist, a
politician, and a minister. The League thinks she does not "embrace"
half enough; but we are modestly of opinion that a woman's embraces
should be confined to her own family circle as closely as possible.</p>
</div>

<p>It would be impossible for any "League," however purely benevolent
its
objects may be, to proceed without subscriptions, and accordingly all
ladies who wish to get "elevated" are requested to send "one shilling"
as a preliminary step towards the happy state alluded to. Any lady may,
however, become qualified for "elevation" for life by a contribution of
five guineas&#8212;a sum so large, that we think few women who take a sober
view of matters in general will like to part with it. We have reasons of
our own for thinking that the "elevation" of Woman would be a dangerous
step, for a woman when once "put up" is not easily put down again.</p>

<h2>THE KENSINGTON BUS-MEN.</h2>

<p>It would be a great convenience to the public if somebody would
undertake the task of issuing a daily guide to apprise us of the
fluctuations in the fares of a Kensington Omnibus. The price of shares,
and the value of the funds are steadiness itself to the ups and downs of
the fares demanded by the Kensington conductors; who frequently vary one
hundred per cent. from the morning to the afternoon in their claims on
the pockets of passengers. We can compare the fluctuations of the
Kensington fares to nothing but the daily changes in the price of fish
or other perishable commodities. On the day of the Cab strike the
Kensington and other Bus-men brought out their fares at much higher
quotations; but the public kept aloof, and very few passengers were
"done" at the increased prices. It is some satisfaction to feel that
after October these "tricks upon travellers" by the savage Bus-men of
the West will be impossible, as the Police Commissioners will fix the
fares, and one may then leave home in the morning with some confidence
that after having paid a fair price to go into town, it will not be
necessary to pay double the sum to get back again by the same
conveyance.</p>

when the Company required that the dog should be packed in a hamper,
they might as well have also insisted on having him packed in ice.</p>

<h2>THE NEW CAB ACT.</h2>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/054.png" alt="M" class="cap" width="30%" />

<p class="cap_4">MADE FOR THE BETTER REGULATION OF PERSONS WHO RIDE IN
CABS, AND FOR THE
BETTER PROTECTION OF THOSE WHO DRIVE THEM.</p>
</div>

<p>(<i>Being the kind of Act that Cabmen would wish to have.</i>)</p>

<p>This Bill will shortly be printed. The following are some of its most
important provisions:&#8212;</p>

<p>The Cabman shall have the option of accepting a fare or not, just as
he
pleases, and he may charge, either by time or distance, precisely as he
likes. If he has travelled a long distance, then he is to have the power
of charging according to the number of miles, but if he has only been a
short journey, and he has taken a long time in going over it, in that
case the Cabman is to be allowed the privilege of charging by the hour.</p>

<p>Any Cabman, fancying he has gone quite far enough&#8212;and Cabmen know
best
for themselves how far they can go&#8212;may suddenly stop, and insist upon
his fare alighting, no matter at what distance the latter may be from
his destination.</p>

<p>The rate of speed to be regulated by the Cabman himself, as it
depends
entirely upon what kind of horse he has got, and whether he has engaged
his fare by time or distance.</p>

<p>In the event of the fare making any complaint, or neglecting to pay
at
once the full sum demanded of him, the Cabman is empowered to drive him
to the nearest station-house, and to have the matter investigated. If in
the wrong, the Cabman may have him fined for incivility, the penalty
whereof shall be a sum not exceeding five pounds, and not less than five
shillings; or, at the discretion of the magistrate, imprisonment, with
or without hard labour, in the House of Correction, for a term not less
than two calendar months.</p>

<p>Any person refusing to give his card, or to be quietly carried to the
station-house, or convicted of having used insulting or disrespectful
language against a Cabman, to be liable to a heavy fine, not exceeding
£50, one-half of which is to go to the <span class="smcap">Queen</span>,
 and the other half to the
Cabman, or an imprisonment as above; and the person so condemned is
further to find two sureties to keep the peace for six months.</p>

<p>Any person convicted of two such offences is to be deprived for ever
of
the privilege of riding in a public cab.</p>

<p>The rate of payment to be two shillings for the first mile, and as
much
as the Cabman likes to charge for every mile after that.</p>

<p>The above rate to be materially increased, if a person is going in a
hurry to a railway, or is returning home late at night, and also on all
special occasions, such as <span class="smcap">Queen's</span> Birthdays,
 Easter and Whitsun
Mondays, Horticultural and Botanical <i>Fête</i> days, and all
illumination
nights, and likewise at all times when it should happen to be hailing,
snowing, or raining.</p>

<p>In the event of a dispute as to distance, the ground to be measured
at
the expense of the person disputing the Cabman's word, and a sum of two
pounds to be paid into Court as a guarantee of the result thereof.</p>

<p>Clause the Thirteenth enacts that, in all matters of dispute, whether
the Cabman shall be proved to be right or wrong, he is to be paid his
expenses, and a certain sum, not less than five shillings, for his loss
of time.</p>

<p>Every person, beyond two, to be charged at the rate of a separate
fare.</p>

<p>Luggage to be charged according to weight, at the same rates demanded
 by
the Parcels' Delivery Company.</p>

<p>Back Fare to be paid on all occasions, and to be doubled after twelve
o'clock.</p>

<p>By the next Clause it is enacted, that ladies are to be charged
one-half
as much again as gentlemen (this clause has been objected to as being
rather stringent, and oppressively severe, but when it is considered the
trouble that ladies give, and how they always object to pay what a
Cabman asks of them, and how they always keep the Cabman waiting, with
their useless arguments and frivolous complaints, it is but right that
the Cabman should be protected against all such contigencies, and be
allowed something extra for his unfeeling waste of time).</p>

<p>Babies, if taken, to be charged each as a separate fare, or else
weighed
as luggage, according to the option of the Cabman.</p>

<p>In no case is the fare to have the power of appeal against the
Magistrate's decision.</p>

<p>There are several minor clauses, but we think we have shown enough of
the New Cab Act to prove that if only one-half of it is carried out, we
shall have not only the Cabmen better protected, but also a better and
more respectable class of riders in cabs.</p>

<h2>OUR MUDDY METROPOLIS.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Palmerston</span> at a recent City dinner
good-humouredly twitted the
Corporation on their dirt, and playfully threw the Thames in the face of
the citizens. The Home Secretary, with a pleasant mixture of urbanity
and satire, entreated the aid of the Londoners in consuming their own
smoke, and absorbing their own mud, with a view to the filtration of
their own river. We suppose his Lordship fancied the City Corporation
might correct the City dirt; as one poison is said to dispel another, on
the principle of <i>similia similibus</i>. We fear the Home Secretary
fails
to see with his usual clearness when he looks at the Thames as a sort of
mirror which is only labouring under a temporary obfuscation, but which
is capable of being restored to that translucent state which, according
to the poets, formerly belonged to it. The Thames is one of those
enormities which none of us can ever hope to see the bottom of.</p>

most humanising of purposes. These damsels&#8212;should matrimony be their
fate&#8212;have every hope that they shall be enabled to win their
gold-digging husbands from an unceasing pursuit of the root of evil,
teaching them that, after all, gold is only the dross of life, and that
there is nothing like virtuous love and contented poverty. These young
enthusiasts have made quite a sensation in the Minories; and one
speculative Hebrew has already offered them very handsome terms to
exhibit themselves. Several entire Jewish families have already
emigrated to the diggings. None of them, it was observed, had pickaxes;

<h2>THE CABMAN AND HIS GOOD AND EVIL REPORT.</h2>

<p>The Reporter of the celebrated Bow Street Cab Case has written to the
<i>Times</i> and to us (our letter is sealed with the official seal of
the
Court) to contradict the contradiction which was given in the House of
Commons to his report of the case of <span class="smcap">Phillips</span>
 the cabman, who would not
or could not put down five shillings for measuring the distance of a
fare with respect to which he was charged with an overcharge.</p>

<p>The Reporter appeals to our sense of justice&#8212;a tribunal to which
nobody
ever appealed in vain; but we cannot see that any injustice has been
done, and therefore the appeal can only meet with a dismissal. The
Reporter and the Magistrate are at issue in their statements of what
took place, but the former's contradiction of the latter had not been
published when our article was at press; and, had it been, we certainly
see no reason why we should believe one party to the discredit of the
other. That reporters are fallible we know by the frequency with which
their inaccuracies are corrected; and we fear the Reporter in question
is capable of making a mistake, for he informs us that "years ago" his
"Bow Street reports led to the dismissal of a very incompetent
magistrate" (which may be possible), "and to the appointment of <span
class="smcap">Mr.
Henry</span> as his successor," which is utterly incredible. We need not
 waste
words in pointing out the absurdity of the assumption that the report of
what was being done by a magistrate at one court, could in the smallest
degree conduce to the appointment of any other magistrate, though the
publicity given to any improper acts of the former might lead to his
dismissal.</p>

<p>In conclusion, we have only to say that the Magistrate gives one
version
of the affair, and the Reporter gives another. Neither magistrates nor
reporters are infallible, and we must therefore leave the public to
decide for themselves which of the two has, on this occasion, been
accurate. The Reporter lays some stress&#8212;and with some show of
reason&#8212;on the alleged fact, that his statement of the case is supported
by a note in the minute-book kept by the clerk, and pried into, as it
seems, rather unceremoniously by the Reporter; but if a magistrate is
liable to err, it is possible that his clerk may be capable of error.
Having performed an act of justice, by recording the protest of the
Reporter against the impeachment of his accuracy, which we noticed last
week, we have done with the subject.</p>

<p>A learned Assistant Judge, while trying a boy for stealing a pudding,
summed up thus:&#8212;"Here's the pudding; up pops the boy, off goes the
pudding, and after him goes the policeman. You've got the boy, the
pudding, and the policeman before you, and now, Gentlemen of the Jury,
consider your verdict." In like manner, we say to the public, "You have
got the report, the Reporter, and the Magistrate before you; therefore,
Gentlemen of England, consider your verdict."</p>

<h2>BAD BEER WITH A GOOD NAME.</h2>

<p>From the report of a recent case in the Rolls Court, it appears that
some rogues have been putting damaged Prestonpans Ale into bottles
labelled with the names of <span class="smcap">Messrs. Bass</span> and <span
 class="smcap">Messrs. Allsopp</span>, and selling
the stuff under these false titles "at fairs and races." We suspect that
this trick is too common. You meet, occasionally, with beer thus
labelled, by which, no doubt, those firms are libelled; for it is a
libel on respectable brewers to impute bad beer to them: and the sort of
bitter beer we allude to is bitter bad. We call it beer, indeed; but we
no more believe that it is made of malt and hops than that it is brewed
by <span class="smcap">Allsopp</span> or by <span class="smcap">Bass</span>,
 whose names appear on the bottles it is sold in,
but, to give a correct idea of their contents, ought to be altered to
<span class="smcap">Base</span> and <span class="smcap">Allslop</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scene.</span>&#8212;<i>The Great Western Railway
Station on the morning of Wednesday,
July 27th. A Train has just arrived, bringing</i>, inter alios et alias,
<span class="smcap">The Unprotected Female</span>, <i>with her usual
moderate but miscellaneous
accumulation of luggage, consisting of a hair-trunk profusely
brass-lettered, and without the slightest lifting appliance in the way
of handles; a cubical black box, with a convex top, very apt to give way
(like its mistress) on slight provocation, and trusting much for support
to a net-work of curiously knotted cordage; an oblong contrivance of
wicker-work and oilskin, like a chicken-basket in a tarpaulin overcoat;
a flower-pot, with a balsam in full blow; a basket, much too small for
its work; four distinct parcels, of respectable dimensions and irregular
form, two in brown paper, one in a newspaper, and the fourth securely
sewed up in huckaback; a large stone bottle of real mushroom ketchup; a
pair of strong shoes, which having obstinately refused to enter the
hair-trunk, have been brought up by hand; an aged, but still expansive,
carpet-bag, bursting with its contents; a bonnet-box and an umbrella,
with a parasol and a camp-stool. As the Scene opens</i>, <span
class="smcap">The Unprotected</span>
<i>is discovered in the act of reclaiming and gathering about her, with
her usual distractedness, these her goods and chattels, as they are
landed from the Luggage-Van, in the midst of a crowd of all ages, sexes,
and conditions, occupied in the same way. The Porters have an
embarrassed air, and not a Cab is to be seen on the Stand. Sharp-witted
Passengers, who have rushed off to secure "first Cab," stand bewildered
on the edge of the Platform. Ladies are huddled helplessly together,
ruefully surveying their baggage. Indignant individuals are asking
questions; and the possession of every inch of room in two fortunate
Omnibuses is being fiercely contested, with very little regard to the

the desolation they have made. A miscellaneous collection of vehicles of

<p class="i0">Dupes of every age and clime, whate'er your station, sex,
or years,</p>
<p class="i0">Lend me all your strength of credence, all your wondrous
length of ears,</p>
<p class="i0">Whilst of things that in the old time in <span
class="smcap">King Arthur's</span> court befel,</p>
<p class="i0">Till his very table moved, a veritable tale I tell.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">Good <span class="smcap">King Arthur</span> had a custom,
whence he swerved not in the least,</p>
<p class="i0">That the morn should bring the tourney, and the noon
should bring the feast,</p>
<p class="i0">For he knew his knights, aye ready for the battle or the
board,</p>
<p class="i0">Were as prompt with knife and cleaver as with battle-axe
and sword,</p>
<p class="i0">With the same good will would carve a haunch and cut a
foeman down,</p>
<p class="i0">And with equal satisfaction crack a marrow-bone or crown;</p>
<p class="i0">Or with smiles and winks would bid them listen to the
nasal tune</p>
<p class="i0">Of the King, who dozed&#8212;"<i>his</i> custom always of an
afternoon."</p>
<p class="i0">Thus in Camelot around the great loo table in the hall</p>
<p class="i0">Just thrice fifty knights were daily ranged by <span
class="smcap">Kaye</span> the Seneschal,</p>
<p class="i0">Whilst <span class="smcap">King Arthur</span> in the
centre of the table took his seat,</p>
<p class="i0">That he might the better notice if his knights were off
their meat.</p>
<p class="i0">'Twas a sultry day in summer: e'en the castle's massive
walls</p>
<p class="i0">Could not keep the heat from out the lofty corridors and
halls:</p>
<p class="i0">Open were the doors and windows (partly for the sake of
air,</p>
<p class="i0">Partly that the baser people might behold them dining
there,</p>
<p class="i0">For in high baronial state but little pleasure would there
 be</p>
<p class="i0">If a crowd of reverential paupers were not there to see),</p>
<p class="i0">And the sunlight, pouring through them, on the shining
armour gleamed</p>
<p class="i0">Gleamed on all the banners bright that over every
chieftain streamed,</p>
<p class="i0">Gleamed upon the golden flagons, and the monarch's
flashing sword</p>
<p class="i0">Laid before him, and his silver beard down flowing on the
board.</p>
<p class="i0">Floating in there came a murmur, of the trees that
whispered near,</p>
<p class="i0">Of the river babbling to the reeds in accents low but
clear,</p>
<p class="i0">Of the birds, and of sweet silver voices from the green
alcove,</p>
<p class="i0">Where <span class="smcap">Ginevra</span> and her maidens
prattled of their champions' love.</p>
<p class="i0">Silent were the knights, and in that happy meditative
mood,</p>
<p class="i0">Which an ample meal induces, each his brother warriors
viewed,</p>
<p class="i2">Thus they sat, and each upon the table laid his brawny
hand,</p>
<p class="i0">Idly musing, till <span class="smcap">Sir Tor</span>, the
youngest of the mighty band,</p>
<p class="i0">Crying, "Why, the table's moving!" pressed against <span
class="smcap">Sir Dinadan</span></p>
<p class="i0">Sitting next him, and impelled him gently towards the good
 <span class="smcap">King Ban</span>.</p>
<p class="i0"><span class="smcap">Ban</span> on <span class="smcap">Bors</span>,
 and <span class="smcap">Bors</span> on <span class="smcap">Pelles</span>,
 <span class="smcap">Pelles</span> on <span class="smcap">Sir Gareth</span>
 leant;</p>
<p class="i0"><span class="smcap">Gareth</span>, bending over <span
class="smcap">Gawain</span>, <span class="smcap">Gawain</span> over <span
 class="smcap">Tristrem</span> bent;</p>
<p class="i0">Thus as each, from each escaping, other upon other drove,</p>
<p class="i0">All, in what logicians call a vicious circle, 'gan to
rove,</p>
<p class="i0">And the table, twirling with them, seemed to each excited
mind,</p>
<p class="i0">Though they pushed it on beside them, to be leaving them
behind.</p>
<p class="i0">Fast and faster flew the table; faster every champion
flew,</p>
<p class="i0">Till the swords, the helms, the banners, flagons, dishes,
faces too,</p>
<p class="i0">Merged in one vast whirling body, many-hued and globiform,</p>
<p class="i0">(Like an old Cartesian whirlwind, or a rotatory storm),</p>
<p class="i0">With <span class="smcap">King Arthur</span> in the centre,
 twirling in his royal chair,</p>
<p class="i0">And his great beard like a pennon streaming on the
troubled air.</p>
<p class="i0">So till now they had been whirling, puffing, stamping,
night and day:</p>
<p class="i0">But <span class="smcap">Sir Ector</span> tripping,
stumbled suddenly on proud <span class="smcap">Sir Kaye</span>:</p>
<p class="i0">As the first impulsive push went, so the fall went
circling round,</p>
<p class="i0">Till the knights, each prone on each like cards, lay
panting on the ground.</p>
<p class="i0">"Certes!" said the good <span class="smcap">King Arthur</span>,
 soon as he had breath to speak,</p>
<p class="i0">And had wiped the dust from off his draggled beard and
pallid cheek,</p>
<p class="i0">"Certes! These be great adventures, such as I remember
not,</p>
<p class="i0">Ever since the death of <span class="smcap">Merlin</span>,
 to have come to Camelot;</p>
<p class="i0">One 'Seat Perilous' he fashioned, when he framed this
board for me;</p>
<p class="i0">But, if thus it takes to moving, perilous each seat will
be.</p>
<p class="i0">Doth its wild unwonted motion then portend some dire
mishap?</p>
<p class="i0">Doth some hidden danger threaten to our crown?"&#8212;A sudden
rap</p>
<p class="i0">Low but clear within the wall the monarch's wise discourse
 broke down</p>
<p class="i0">Saying, plain as rap <i>could</i> say, "A rap is
threatened to thy crown."</p>
<p class="i0">"Perdy!" said the startled monarch. "What strange visitant
 thus shocks</p>
<p class="i0">All our ears at such a moment? It must be the ghost of&#8212;"
Knocks</p>
<p class="i0">Two or three upon the wall came, ere "of <span
class="smcap">Merlin</span>," he could say.</p>
<p class="i0">Then <span class="smcap">Sir Lancelot</span> stepped
before him, as the echoes died away.</p>
<p class="i0">"If a knight should fly from knocks, 'twould surely be a
parlous shame,"</p>
<p class="i0">Said he. "Wherefore to accomplish this adventure I shall
claim.</p>
<p class="i0">I will take my horse and spear and journey down to Caer
Lud,</p>
<p class="i0">Where '<span class="smcap">Linette</span>, the damsel
sauvage,'<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a
href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> dwells beside the Fleet's
clear flood;</p>
<p class="i0">All the meaning of this marvel she shall tell, and let me
see</p>
<p class="i0">All the glories of the future, and the wonders that shall
be.</p>
<p class="i0">Ho! Sir Butler, bring me quickly four men's shares of wine
 and meat,</p>
<p class="i0">That, as much as may suffice me for my journey, I may
eat."</p>
<p class="i0">Seemed to him, as forth he journeyed, that the land was
passing strange;</p>
<p class="i0">Was it sooth, or was it glamour that had worked so great a
 change?</p>
<p class="i0">For the moorland and the woodland, where with horse, and
hound, and horn,</p>
<p class="i0">He had chased the boar and aurochs, glowed with summer's
ripening corn;</p>
<p class="i0">At the well known fording-places stately bridges stemmed
the tide,</p>
<p class="i0">Turnpikes, 'stead of knights or giants, barred his way on
either side;</p>
<p class="i0">Feeble women, damp and dingy, for a trifle came to show</p>
<p class="i0">All the ruins of the castles he had kept with many a blow;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">And where cross-roads met, and where the best adventures
once had been,</p>
<p class="i0">Whitewashed sign-posts bade him turn to Frogmore Pound, or
 Pogis Green.</p>
<p class="i0">Now and then athwart his course came, with a rumble and a
scream,</p>
<p class="i0">Green and golden creatures, glaring fierce, and breathing
fire and steam,</p>
<p class="i0">Seemed that each was dragging on a thousand victims at the
 least:</p>
<p class="i0">"By my knighthood," quoth <span class="smcap">Sir Lancelot</span>,
 "this must be 'the questing beast;'</p>
<p class="i0">Something rusty have I grown by dwelling there at peace so
 long,</p>
<p class="i0">For ever eating of the fat, and ever drinking of the
strong,</p>
<p class="i0">Yet with stout and knightly valour I shall dress me to the
 fight;"</p>
<p class="i0">But, before his lance was couched, "the questing beast"
was out of sight.</p>
<p class="i0">So he journeyed till, one evening, from the hill-top
looking down</p>
<p class="i0">As the setting sun in gold and crimson bathed the mighty
town</p>
<p class="i0">All the spires, and masts, and towers (that seemed as they had
 lent the skies</p>
<p class="i0">Gauds from London's wealth to deck them) flashed upon his
wond'ring eyes.</p>
<p class="i0">"This adventure," said <span class="smcap">Sir Lancelot</span>,
 "I may scarcely understand,"</p>
<p class="i0">So he wisely brought his good sword closer to his strong
right hand.</p>
<p class="i2">To "<span class="smcap">Linette</span> the damsel Sauvage"
 who abode on Ludgate Hill,</p>
<p class="i0">He arrived at length by dint of wondrous toil and care and
 skill;</p>
<p class="i0">In a four-pair back she dwelt, and it was noted on her
door,</p>
<p class="i0">That she held "<i>mesmeriques séances</i>" every afternoon
 at four.</p>
<p class="i0">Seemed that she was greatly altered from the blooming girl
 who brought</p>
<p class="i0">Fair Dame <span class="smcap">Lyons</span> and <span
class="smcap">Sir Gareth</span> home to Royal <span class="smcap">Arthur's</span>
 Court</p>
<p class="i0">She whose witchcraft (witch they called her) in her beauty
seemed to lie;</p>
<p class="i0">Red, but not with bloom, her cheek was; bright, but not
with health, her eye,</p>
<p class="i0">And her mouth, whose slightest smile had won the hearts of
 <span class="smcap">Arthur's</span> train,</p>
<p class="i0">By its pale thin lips' quick tremor half confessed the
inward pain.</p>
<p class="i0">Much she laughed, when <span class="smcap">Lancelot</span>
 told her what had brought him to her door,</p>
<p class="i0">And how <span class="smcap">Arthur's</span> famous knights
 had sprawled upon the sandy floor.</p>
<p class="i0">"Though," said she, "my quick clairvoyant spirit saw the
merry scene,</p>
<p class="i0">And I heard you ask each other what the mystic raps might
mean;</p>
<p class="i0">So I cast a glamour round you, that your dazzled eyes
might see</p>
<p class="i0">All the glories of the future, and the wonders that shall
be.</p>
<p class="i0">Ask not why the table moved or what the mystic raps may
be;</p>
<p class="i0">Marvels, such as these, we Media can't explain without a
fee;</p>
<p class="i0">But be sure, these things that fright thee in the future
shall not fail</p>
<p class="i0">To avenge thee on the men who'll deem <i>thy</i> fame an
idle tale.</p>
<p class="i0">Though the men of future ages you and yours shall despise,</p>
<p class="i0">They shall not be wholly prescient, and not altogether
wise;</p>
<p class="i0">Some defect, to prove them human, shall their brightest
plans deface;</p>
<p class="i0">Follies worthy of the weakest, shall the wisest age
disgrace;</p>
<p class="i0">And as if <i>some</i> superstition still the human brain <i>must</i>
 bother,</p>
<p class="i0">They shall but shake off one folly to be taken with
another,</p>
<p class="i0">So that those, who all the tales of <span class="smcap">Arthur</span>
 as mere lies reprove,</p>
<p class="i0">Shall believe his great round table by his knights' mere
will could move."</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">As she spoke the glamour faded, and <span class="smcap">Sir
 Lancelot</span> saw the moor</p>
<p class="i0">And the woodland stretching out for many a league his road
 before;</p>
<p class="i0">Many a sign of knoll and headland marked an old familiar
spot,</p>
<p class="i0">So, upon the vision musing, back he rode to Camelot.</p>

had only met sneers and

<p>Some people value any kind of popularity. <span class="smcap">Mr.
Bright</span> may exult in the
shouts of the least respectable Manchester people. <span class="smcap">Lord
 Dudley Stuart</span>
may like to be cheered by the baser sort of Marylebonians. <span

Carter</span> may rejoice in the huzzas of the lowest classes of the
population
at Winchester. <span class="smcap">Sir Robert Inglis</span> may be
elated with the applause of the
inferior portion of the inhabitants of Ratcliff Highway. If they do,
they will be proud of the position they occupy in the good graces of the
proprietors of dirty cabs, miserable horses, and abusive, rapacious
fellows.</p>

<p>It must be rather flattering to Church Dignitaries to observe what
company they are in, as eulogists and admirers of the Honourable Member
for Oxford. The fact itself is not wonderful; for cab fares as they
were, and episcopal incomes as they are, are things not very dissimilar,
except in having been eightpence a mile on the one hand, and being from
five to twenty thousand pounds per annum and upwards on the other.</p>

<h2>RECOVERY FROM THE CABMEN'S STRIKE.</h2>

<center>(<i>To the Editor of "Punch".</i>)</center>

<p class="salute">"<span class="smcap">Sir,</span></p>

<p>"Permit me to relate the particulars of my wonderful recovery of the
use
of my limbs, and consequent restoration to health. I was afraid the
strike of the Cabmen yesterday would have been a great blow to me. I
found that I had to walk three miles to my office. Sir, I expected that
exertion to be my death. I have been for years a sufferer from
indigestion, occasioning an unpleasant emptiness before meals, and an
oppressive fulness afterwards, and attended by headache, giddiness,
dimness of sight, shortness of breath, and other premonitory symptoms of
apoplexy. I have been bled and cupped, and have taken all sorts of
medicine; made my stomach a regular doctor's shop, and not only that but
a College of Vegetable Pills and a <span class="smcap">Holloway's</span>
 Depôt. Under these
circumstances, I should never have dreamt of walking three miles, if I
had not been obliged to do it. I did it, though. It exhausted me a
little. It threw me into a perspiration. But, sir, it gave me an
appetite for my dinner such as I had not experienced for years. I ate
and drank heartily; I had not enjoyed anything so much since I don't
know when; and after an unusually ample indulgence in the pleasures of
the table, I sunk into a refreshing slumber, which I understand was
unaccompanied by stertorous breathing. Sir, I shall continue to walk to
my office&#8212;whereby I shall invigorate my frame, improve my appetite,
save Cab-hire certainly, avoid liability to extortion and insolence, and
lose some of the weight without any of the importance of</p>

<h2>PETITION FROM THE MEDICAL PROFESSION.</h2>

<center>"<i>To the Right Hon. the House of Commons:</i></center>

<blockquote>"The Petition of the undersigned sheweth,</blockquote>

<p>"That your Petitioners are members of the medical profession, and
earn
their living by the sale of pills, plaisters, boluses, black draughts,
blisters, powders, and similar commodities, which are administered or
applied to persons suffering from sickness, indigestion, bile, lowness
of spirits, drunkenness, dissipation, and general debility.</p>

<p>"That your Petitioners are deeply interested in the condition of the
working classes of great cities&#8212;who toil through excessive hours of
labour, and dwell in close, unwholesome habitations. Your Petitioners
have ever found their largest and most valuable practice among this
class of the community&#8212;and continue to do so, notwithstanding the
miserable and abortive attempts of Government, and of weak-minded
enthusiasts, to interfere with their trade&#8212;by improving, 'as it is
called,' the dwellings of the poor, and preaching against bad drainage,
dirt, and drunkenness.</p>

<p>"Your Petitioners view with alarm and indignation the proposed
desecration of the Sunday, by opening the Crystal Palace and its
grounds, at Sydenham, to the people of London; and cannot but express
their conviction that it would lead to the infliction of serious loss on
the profession of which they are members.</p>

<p>"Your Petitioners humbly call the attention of your Honourable House
to
the fact that they derive a very considerable revenue from the following
sources, all of which are threatened to be diminished by the increase of
parks, pleasure gardens, and conservatories for the working classes.</p>

<blockquote><p>"First, From fevers and other diseases generated by
heated and
impure atmosphere; from which even one day's escape in seven may
tend to relieve the present dwellers in the dark courts and alleys
of London.</p>

<p>"Secondly, From adulterated gin and British brandy, which are
consumed in vast quantities by a large portion of the aforesaid
dwellers in dark places, who seek in these stimulants some little
excitement during their brief repose from the daily labour of life.</p>

<p>"Lastly, From broken heads, bruises, black eyes, &amp;c., all of
which
require a considerable amount of medical treatment, 'both in the
hospitals and out,' on Monday mornings.</p></blockquote>

<p>"Your Petitioners forbear to enter into the religious portion of the
argument, as they do not exactly remember the text in the New Testament
which forbids the walking in corn-fields, or gardens, or conservatories
on the Sunday; but your Petitioners are of opinion that your Honourable
House ought to preserve these privileges as heretofore for Earls,
Bishops, and wealthy members of your Honourable House, who can afford to
keep gardens and conservatories at their private expense.</p>

<p>"Your Petitioners therefore pray your Honourable House to protect
'<i>their native industry</i>'&#8212;by keeping the doors of the Crystal
Palace
and its gardens closed against the working classes of London."</p>

<h2>THE CABMAN AND HIS PINT OF STOUT.&#8212;<span class="smcap">A Fable.</span></h2>

<p>A Cabman, being inclined to drink, stepped into a public-house, and
asked for a pint of stout, which he swallowed at a draught, and in
payment for the liquor laid down a fourpenny piece. The landlord, who
chanced to be serving in the bar, being a wag, called after his
customer, as the latter was going, "Hi there, you!" to which the other,
turning his head, replied, "Halloa!"&#8212;"Come, I say!" pursued mine host,
"this here won't do!"&#8212;"Wot won't do?" demanded the other.&#8212;"Wot?" the
landlord repeated; "wot's this here?"&#8212;"Wot's this here?" returned the
cabman; "why, it's a fo'p'ny bit, isn't it?"&#8212;"Well, and wot then?"
cried the landlord.&#8212;"Wot dy'e mean?" retorted the cabman.&#8212;"Wot do you
mean?" rejoined the landlord; "wot dy'e mean this here for?"&#8212;"For a
pint o' stout, to be sure," was the cabman's answer.&#8212;"Ho, ho, ho, ho!"
shouted the landlord.&#8212;"Wot are yer larfin' at?" exclaimed the cabman,
in astonishment; "Fo'pence a pint o' stout&#8212;ain't that right!"&#8212;"I
s'pose," replied the landlord, "yer calls yerself a gentleman."</p>

<p>Here the people who were tippling at the bar burst into a loud laugh,
which awoke the cabman to a perception that the landlord had been making
game of him. "Come, come," said Boniface, "I was only chaffin' you; but
now I hope you'll see the propriety of takin' wot you're entitled to
when you're offered it, without indulgin' in superfluous and unpleasant
hobservations."</p>

<h2>ST. LUKE'S AND ST. STEPHEN'S.</h2>

<p>Posterity will scratch his head when he meets with the subjoined
passages whilst studying the Parliamentary intelligence in an ancient
file of the <i>Times</i>. <span class="smcap">Mr. C. Berkeley</span>,
moving the House into Committee on
the Expenses of Elections' Bill, said</p>

<blockquote><p>"It was now a Bill merely to prevent the use of bands,
bell-ringing,
and colours at elections."</p></blockquote>

<p>After some remarks by <span class="smcap">Mr. Cowper</span> against
the Bill,</p>

<blockquote><p>"<span class="smcap">Colonel Sibthorpe</span> then rose
to move, in pursuance of notice, that
the Bill be deferred for three months. He said he had read the Bill
carefully over, and he thought he had designated it as it deserved,
when on a former occasion he had called it a mean, low, dirty bill.
(<i>Laughter.</i>) It was a dangerous and delusive measure; it was a
trap
set for unwary men, who might suddenly find themselves to have been
guilty of an offence which they had no intention of committing ...
It restricted the liberty of the subject...."</p></blockquote>

<p>However, the House went into Committee on the Bill; and the <span
class="smcap">Colonel</span> took
the opportunity of renewing his protest against it: declaring that</p>

<blockquote><p>"He would oppose the Bill in every stage, for he regarded
 it as a
disgraceful, mean, dirty, shabby measure."</p></blockquote>

<p>After the odd remark had been made by <span class="smcap">Mr. F.
Scully</span>, that</p>

<blockquote><p>"With regard to the carrying of flags and banners, he had
 no doubt
that in England such services were frequently made the means of
corruption,"</p></blockquote>

<p>The report proceeds to state that</p>

<blockquote><p>"<span class="smcap">Sir J. Graham</span> thought the
best course would be to give up this
Bill, and proceed as soon as possible with the next order on the
paper, the Lunatics' Care and Treatment Bill."</p></blockquote>

<p>Proceed with the <i>next</i> Bill&#8212;the Lunatics' Care and Treatment
Bill? How
the <i>next</i> Bill? A Bill on the showing of which it appears that
certain
poor creatures were in the habit of going about trumpeting, drumming,
bell-ringing, carrying flags&#8212;enacting such fooleries as these&#8212;on the
solemn occasion of electing a Member of Parliament; of contributing a
philosopher to the Collective Wisdom; a Bill in reference to
unfortunates corruptible by means of flags and banners: how, a rational
Posterity will ask, could this have been a previous Bill to the other?
Must not what was called the next Bill have been, in fact, merely the
next clause of the same Bill; a general measure relating to the care and
treatment of lunatics?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colonel Sibthorpe's</span> denunciations of the
proposed enactment will not,
perhaps, tend very much to prevent Posterity from taking this view of
the case.</p>

<h2>THE BETTING HOUSE DEPUTATION.</h2>

<blockquote><p>"A deputation against the proposed Bill for the
suppression of
betting-houses had an interview with <span class="smcap">Viscount

yesterday."&#8212;<i>Court Circular, Thursday.</i></p></blockquote>

</div>

<p>Early on the above day, <i>Mr. Punch</i> received a note from his
friend,
<span class="smcap">Lord Palmerston</span>, apprising him that such a
deputation was expected at
the Home Office, and asking him to "come down." <i>Mr. Punch</i>, who is
always ready to come down in a good cause, immediately complied, and may
indeed add, that from the disgraceful state of Whitehall (proverbially
the worst swept, kept, drained, and watered street in London), <i>Mr.
Punch</i> was laughingly charged by his noble friend, on entering, with
having "come down with the dust." <i>Mr. Punch</i> need hardly remark
that
his retort was triumphant. The Home Secretary and his friend were soon
apprised that the Betting-house Keepers were in attendance. Buttoning up
their pockets, therefore, the two statesmen directed that their visitors
should be introduced.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Palmerston's</span> easy manner, not
unmingled with a pleasant
scornfulness (scarcely perceptible to the fine natures of the
Deputation), was a model of the best style of Reception. <i>Mr. Punch</i>
 was
sterner&#8212;he could not smile on such folk. His appearance threw the
Deputation into manifest consternation, and one of the fraternity was
heard to observe, with a most irreverent reference to one of <i>Mr.
Punch's</i> features, that "if Nosey was to be heerd, it was all Queer
Street." The vulgar party was supposed to mean that <i>Mr. Punch's</i>
well-known sentiments on the subject of Betting-houses would render
remonstrance ineffective.</p>

<p>"Well, gentlemen," said the Home Secretary, with the smallest
inflexion
on the latter word, "I promised to see you. What have you got to say?"</p>

<p>"Why, my lord," said a keen, slangy-looking man, with tight light
trowsers, a scampish cut-away coat, and a dark blue cravat, adorned with
a huge horseshoe pin, "we think, that is me and the rest of us, <span
class="smcap">Mr.
Bolt</span>, <span class="smcap">Mr. Saint Levant</span>, <span
class="smcap">Mr. Diddles</span>, <span class="smcap">Mr. Flypaper</span>,
 <span class="smcap">Mr. Whitewash</span>, and
these other gents" (gracefully introducing each on naming him)
"including your humble, namely myself <span class="smcap">Mr. Doobrus</span>,
 we think, my lord,
that in this matter Parliament is rather down upon us, and that it ain't
the thing. We want your lordship to see it in that light."</p>

<p>"I am open to&#8212;to&#8212;to&#8212;a&#8212;to conviction," said his lordship; "or, if the
word is offensive to any gentleman present, I will say, to argument."</p>

<p>"My lord," said <span class="smcap">Mr. Doobrus</span>, impressively,
 "the British turf is a noble
and manly recreation, fostered by princes, and encouraging the finest
breed of&#8212;"</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Mr.</span>&#8212;a&#8212;<span class="smcap">Doobrus</span>,"
 interrupted his lordship. "<i>Mr. Punch's</i> time and my
own is valuable. Please to keep to the point. Betting-houses have
nothing whatever to do with the turf, so suppose we don't talk nonsense.
If you can give me any reasons why gambling-shops, that demoralise the
rising generation and fill the gaols (with, I am sorry to say, the
customers, not the dealers), should not be suppressed, do. But as to
talking of the turf, you might as well tell me that St. Paul's is a big
church, or, what is a little more to the purpose, that the House of
Correction is in Coldbath Fields."</p>

<p>"But, my lord, as a racing man, you must know&#8212;"</p>

<p>"I am not a racing man, <span class="smcap">Mr. Doobrus</span>, but I
 have some race-horses. But
once more, leave out of the question that which we have nothing to do
with. We are speaking as men of business. It's all very well to cant out
of doors about "one law for the rich and another for the poor," and to
say that "<span class="smcap">Jack Jones</span> has as much right to bet
 his half-crown on <i>Joe
Miller</i>, as <span class="smcap">Lord Battleaxe</span> has to bet his
thousand pounds on
<i>Hydaspes</i>", but that trash is of no use here. Rich and poor has
nothing
to do with the matter, except that you do your best to make the rich
poor and the poor poorer. But when you take <span class="smcap">Jack
Jones's</span> half-crown he
no more bets on <i>Joe Miller</i> than on the Moon. He knows and cares
nothing about <i>Joe Miller</i>, but he wants to gamble, and a horse's
name
does as well for that purpose as anything else. What has <span
class="smcap">Jack Jones</span> to
do with the turf, or you either?"</p>

<p>"But, my lord," exclaimed all the Deputation, "<span class="smcap">Jack</span>
 has a right to
gamble."</p>

<p>"Let him. But you shall not keep gambling-houses to tempt and ruin
him.
The law forbids them to the rich, and so it shall to the poor. The Bill
will be law this day fortnight. Anything more to say, gentlemen?"</p>

<p>The Deputation retired, considerably disgusted, and were understood
to
have subsequently made particular inquiries as to the cost of passages
to Australia.</p>

<h2>THE TEA-TOTAL MOVEMENT.</h2>

<p>The Tea-totallers&#8212;whose zeal we much admire, though we cannot rush
into
the cistern or hang on to the pump with all the ardour they display in
their attempts to bring an hydraulic pressure to bear on public
opinion&#8212;have published a sort of summary of their achievements. They
have forwarded "30,000 letters" to noblemen, &amp;c., from which we
infer
that they have filled at least 300 waste-paper baskets, and furnished
wrappers to several thousand quarters of pounds of butter. They have
held several hundred "tea-meetings," and they might have added, "munched
a million muffins," to say nothing of the consumption of crumpets, which
must have been something marvellous. They have delivered some thousands
of lectures on water, and have probably exhausted a great many highly
respectable pumps in the operation.</p>

<p>We find from a prospectus, that the hot days of August are about to
be
refreshed by a flood of American eloquence, which is about to be "turned
on" at Exeter Hall, through the medium of a <span class="smcap">Mr.
Gough</span>, of whom it is
said that "he makes strong men to weep like little children, and women,
to sob as if their hearts would burst." This command over the tears of
his audience is an appropriate attribute to one whose mission is to
popularise water; and there can be no doubt that when every eye around
him is gushing with moisture, he will feel himself quite in his element.
If he bears out the reputation he brings with him, his lectures will be
no laughing matter; for he is, as it were, pledged to set all the men
and women off into so many watering-pots, by drawing from them such a
series of wailings and sobs, as will not only drown the voice of the
orator, but threaten even to drown those who are assembled to hear him.
We hope the Trustees of Exeter Hall will see to the drainage of the
building before these orations come off, or we do not know what may be
the result of a combination of several thousand floods of tears with the
orator's flood of eloquence.</p>

<hr />

<h2>THE REAL SMOKE NUISANCE.</h2>

<p>We must confess that our objection to the Smoke Nuisance does not
extend
so much to the honest chimney-pot of private life, or to the tall
smoke-evolving structure of manufacturing industry, as to that useless
and disgusting object, the street smoker, who puffs his "cheap and
nasty" cigar in the faces of innocent passengers. We sincerely hope that
<span class="smcap">Lord Palmerston</span> will render it imperative on
those offensive locomotives
to consume their own smoke in some way or other. They are usually of a
class that may be got to swallow almost anything, and we would therefore
suggest that they be called upon to swallow their own smoke, for in the
event of there being no other outlet, their mouths are always open to
them.</p>

harmoniously, is likely to be disturbed by the fact of Russia, who is,
really, very clever on the base, wishing to play first-fiddle.</p>

<h2>A CHANCE FOR THE POOR CLERGY.</h2>

<p>It is certainly scandalous that there should be any sale of livings,
though, if the practice must exist, we are happy to find that a "good
living" may be bought for a sum within the crippled means of a poor
clergyman, who has not yet exhausted the whole of his begging and
borrowing resources and energies. The annexed advertisement will, we
trust, attract the attention of the sons of the clergy who may be
induced to confer the "good living" on one of the thousands of poor
parsons whom the clergy's sons claim the especial privilege of aiding
and comforting. The advertisement is copied literally from the <i>Times</i>
newspaper.</p>

<blockquote><p>A GOOD LIVING.&#8212;To be SOLD, a new PATENT MANGLE, by Baker,
 with good
business attached, suitable for any industrious person desirous of
obtaining a respectable livelihood. Price £12. Apply at, &amp;c.</p></blockquote>

<p>There is a "good living" to be had for twelve pounds, and it is
evidently a much better thing than the average run of small curacies,
for it will enable a person to obtain "a respectable livelihood."</p>

<p>We are glad to find that the condition of the poor clergy is at
length
being looked at in its proper light, and that a good mangle may be
advertised as a "good living" so as to catch at once the eye of the
clerical class to whom the owner of the mangle has evidently addressed
himself. We shall really begin to hope that the wretched condition of
the underpaid clergyman is beginning to "take a turn," if we can find in
Reverend hands a few mangles with "good livings" attached to them.</p>

<h2>LOVE'S LABOUR LOST AT LIMERICK.</h2>

<p>Of what use is it to read a good book and transgress its rules in the
very act?</p>

<p>The <i>Times</i> has a paragraph, stating that two London
missionaries, the
<span class="smcap">Rev. Messrs. Dickinson</span> and <span
class="smcap">Lewis</span>, attempted to read and expound the
Scriptures to a crowd in Limerick on Sunday evening; when&#8212;</p>

<blockquote><p>"After a few minutes a mob collected and set upon the
Reverend
gentlemen, who were severely maltreated. It is computed that 10,000
of the <i>canaille</i> of Limerick were engaged in hooting, yelling, and
throwing stones, where they could with safety to themselves, at the
obnoxious clergymen."</p></blockquote>

<p>Oh, <span class="smcap">Mr. Dickinson</span>! Oh, <span class="smcap">Mr.
 Lewis</span>! <i>Punch</i> does not quote anything above
<span class="smcap">Shakspeare</span>; but how could you&#8212;Reverend
gentlemen&#8212;how could you scatter
sacred words before the Limerick multitude? Have you not sufficiently
studied the volume you were reading from to recollect what it says about
pearls and&#8212;Limerick multitudes? Well&#8212;you have disobeyed the
precept&#8212;and taken the consequences.</p>

we
wonder how the servants pronounce it at an evening party?</p>

saddled the country with Commissions than any other Government.</p>

<h2>THE TAILOR ASSASSIN.</h2>

<p>An unhappy French tailor has been charged, on the evidence of our old
friend <span class="smcap">Joinville</span>, with a conspiracy to
assassinate our old enemy <span class="smcap">Louis
Napoleon</span>. The "conspiracy" looks very like an attempt on our
gracious
Queen, for the unhappy wretch of a tailor wanted <span class="smcap">Her
 Majesty's</span> head on
twenty pieces of gold coin, and his design was directed far more upon
English sovereigns than upon French Napoleons. Twenty pounds was the
price to be charged by the French tailor for making his country free and
happy; but, considering that the trade of patriotism is rather at a low
ebb just now, we cannot help thinking that the unfortunate humbug placed
his services at too high a figure.</p>

<p>Whether the accused really contemplated the murder of <span
class="smcap">Louis Napoleon</span> is
doubtful, though <span class="smcap">Mr. Bodkin</span> was engaged to
argue that the tailor
designed the <i>quietus</i> of the Emperor with, perhaps, "a bare
Bodkin,"
which, being the instrument of his trade, might have been the intended
instrument of his iniquity. Our private opinion of the matter is that
the French vagabond, instead of wishing to shed the blood of the present
ruler of France, was anxious only to make the <span class="smcap">Prince
 de Joinville</span>
"bleed" to the tune of twenty sovereigns. Instead of elevating the scamp
into a political conspirator, it would be better to treat him at once as
a swindler and a would-be obtainer of money under false pretences. There
is no greater "mistake" than to assign political motives to a merely
mercenary act, and to arraign as a monster, who would have murdered an
Emperor, a poor insignificant adventurer who, though utterly hopeless of
a "clean shirt," may have aspired to the chance of "a guinea."</p>

<hr />

<h4>The Maims of Money.</h4>

<p>You scarcely ever receive change for a sovereign without finding that
one of the shillings or sixpences has had a hole drilled through it,
which&#8212;suggesting a painful doubt as to the exchangeable value of the
coin&#8212;is altogether a bore. We are glad that <span class="smcap">Mr.
Wilson</span> has got leave to
bring in a bill to prevent the defacing of the <span class="smcap">Queen's</span>
 money; and we
hope this measure will have the effect of remedying one of the greatest
evils of change.</p>

<h2>KENILWORTH CHURCH AND KENILWORTH CASTLE.</h2>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/066.png" alt="T" class="cap" width="35%" />

<p class="cap_3">THERE has reached <i>Mr. Punch</i> a very good-humoured
 letter from a
Reverend gentleman suggesting to him the expediency of subscribing £10
or £20 towards the endowment of a new church at Kenilworth, in order to
show that he, <i>Mr. Punch</i>, is not opposed to the Christian
observance of
Sunday, which might, the worthy clergyman seems to think, be inferred
from his objection to the Jewish observance of it.</p>
</div>

<p>The idea of a church at Kenilworth is peculiarly happy. On Sundays it
might be a counter-attraction to the Castle. Success to the exertions of
the minister that is to preach in it to render it such!</p>

<p>Our clerical correspondent's suggestion is ingenious; it merits
attention: it shall be attended to in good time.</p>

<p>If <i>Mr. Punch's</i> ideas&#8212;and circulation&#8212;were narrow, he might
plead
that the church at Kenilworth is not in his own parish. But that would
be an invalid as well as a sneaking excuse for parsimony. The parish of
<i>Punch</i> is the world.</p>

<p>When all the property appertaining to the Established Church has been
 so
distributed among the clergy as to maintain every one of them, bishops
and all, in a style of apostolical competence, and when the whole of the
surplus thus created shall have been applied to the endowment of new
churches, then, if any more money is wanted for that purpose, <i>Mr.
Punch</i> will be most happy to contribute as much as ever he is able;
and
his munificence shall, in the very first place, effuse itself upon the
new church at Kenilworth.</p>

<hr />

<h2>STRIKING CIRCUMSTANCES.</h2>

<p>Really <span class="smcap">John Bull</span> may almost be described
as a maniac with lucid
intervals. He appears to be always suffering under some form of mania or
other. A few years ago it was the Railway Mania&#8212;a very dangerous
phrenzy. Then from time to time occurs a Poultry Mania, or one of the
similar and milder forms of insanity. The mania now prevailing is one
which, if not attended to, may perhaps prove troublesome. This is the
Striking Mania. Everybody is Striking. The other day it was the cabmen;
now it is the Dockyard labourers; the policemen, even, have struck and
thrown down their staves. Our mechanics have so far become machines,
that, like clocks, as clocks ought to be, they are all striking
together.</p>

<p>Should this mania spread, we shall have Striking become what might be
called the order, but that it will be the disorder, of the day. The
professions will strike; you will send for your lawyer to make your
will, and your messenger will return with <i>non est inventus</i>&#8212;struck;
 or
should you ask the legal gentleman a six-and-eightpenny question, you
will discover that he has struck for 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> The
physicians and
surgeons will strike for two-guinea fees; the apothecaries for
ten-shilling mixtures. The clergy will all strike&#8212;as indeed some of
them, the poor curates, might reasonably do&#8212;and pluralists will be
demanding forty thousand a year instead of twenty; whilst bishops will
hang up the mitre, stick the crosier over the chimney-piece, and hold
out against the Ecclesiastical Commissioners for double incomes. In
short, almost everybody will strike except the threshers, the smiths,
and the pugilists.</p>

<p>With all this striking, though, we had better take care that we are
not
floored.</p>

<hr />

<h4>Musical Intelligence.</h4>

great deal about it lately&#8212;a celebrated professor says: "You generally

<h2>THE POPULAR LAURIE BALLAD</h2>

<p>There is a song to which we have alluded before, called "<i>Annie
Laurie</i>," being sung at all the Mansion House dinners; and though <span
 class="smcap">Annie</span>
is the name in common use, there can be no doubt that <span
class="smcap">Peter</span> is the party
whom the ballad is designed to flatter. We have therefore engaged our
own Laureate in the graceful task of fixing on the head of the <span
class="smcap">Lauries</span>
the honour which had been conferred on <span class="smcap">Annie</span>,
 by a poet evidently
unconscious of the "coming" Alder-"man."</p>

<h2>WONDERS OF THE DEEP.</h2>

<p>We paid a visit to the Regent's Park Zoological Gardens the other
day,
for the purpose of noticing the collection of Mollusca, Zoophytes,
&amp;c.,
and very much regret to find it incomplete.</p>

<p>There are specimens from the German Ocean and the Bristol Channel,
but
none from the Sees of London, Durham, Rochester, or Salisbury, the
rapacity of whose tenants is so well known, that there is no doubt,
could their destructive propensities be as clearly seen as those now
exhibiting, the very Sees themselves would be drained to stop their
depredations.</p>

<p>On inquiring the reason of the absence of so interesting a
collection,
we were told that although a variety of nets, such as the Ecclesiastical
Commission, <span class="smcap">Whiston's</span> Inquiries, and others,
have been tried, they have
never succeeded in bringing these very recondite creatures above the
surface, for when they perceive their approach to public gaze, they
become so alarmed, and struggle so violently, as always to succeed in
escaping to their natural shelter among the riches deposited at the
bottom of their Sees.</p>

<p>The most rapacious among them is said to be the "Episcopus," as only
one
of them can be found in a See. This will not cause surprise, for it has
been ascertained that £10,000 per annum is devoured by a single
specimen. The Episcopus is always attended by a crowd of Rectors,
Canons, and Vicars, who are all more or less grabiferous.</p>

<p>These curious animals are said to possess a peculiarity wanting in
all
other species, that of ubiquity; as they are supposed to be able to be
in several places at once.</p>

<hr />

<h2>SHOCKING LANGUAGE.</h2>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir,</span>&#8212;The papers inform us that <span
class="smcap">Mr. Phillimore</span>, the other night, asked
the President of the Board of Control why the returns given in the case
of '<span class="smcap">Rustomjee Viccajee</span> and <span
class="smcap">Viccajee Pestonjee</span>' were incomplete? That a
subject, evidently surrounded with ease, should be attended with
difficulty is certainly strange. But I want to know, if you can inform
me, who or what '<span class="smcap">Rustomjee Viccajee</span> and <span
 class="smcap">Viccajee Pestonjee</span>,' aforesaid
are? I thought at first that these words were specimens of the 'foul
language' used by cabmen and others as complained of by <span
class="smcap">Colonel
Sibthorpe</span>. Am I right? By the bye, while on the subject of bad
words,
may I ask (indignantly, as the father of a family) how it is that
<span class="smcap">Professor Gregory</span> and other chemists are not
restrained from circulating
such words as the following: Methylethylamylophenylium,
Ethylopropylamylamine, Methylethylamylophenylammonium; 76 letters in
three words&#8212;my hand aches with writing them. To be sure, as a set-off,
these professors sometimes give us something more euphonious; 'Margarate
of Glycerine' sounds like the title of a novel, but then whoever heard
of 'Glycerine?' Where is it? What did Margarate there, and is she a
descendant of <span class="smcap">Margaret of Anjou</span>? I trust that
 you will be able to give
me some information, or, at any rate, give your assistance in the cause
of monosyllabic simplicity.</p>

<p class="author">"<span class="smcap">Buzfuz.</span>"</p>

<p>"P.S. 'What's in a name?' is a question that has been often asked. I

<h2>MR. PETERLOO BROWN'S EXAMINATION OF THE OXFORD STATUTES.</h2>

<p class="salute">"<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Punch</span>,</p>

<p>"I appeal to you in a case of difficulty, and trust that my
familiarity
will not beget your contempt. My name is <span class="smcap">Brown</span>:
 not an uncommon surname,
perhaps, but I am distinguished by my Christian name of <span
class="smcap">Peterloo</span>. My
eldest lad is called after me, and it is in his behalf, <i>Mr. Punch</i>,
that I crave your advice. He is at present an Eton <i>boy</i>, but he
will
soon be ready to be an Oxford <i>man</i>, and I am now looking forward
to his
matriculation. You are, doubtless, Sir, aware that every one who goes
through that form has to subscribe to certain oaths and conditions,
before he can be admitted to the privileges of the University. I myself
never had the benefit of a University education, but I am well aware how
it helps a man to gain a position in society&#8212;a position which my rapid
rise to fortune has only in part secured to me; for there are, <i>Mr.
Punch</i>, aristocrats by birth, who turn up their noses at us
aristocrats
by wealth, and yet will stoop to&#8212;&#8212; however, to return to my son. I am
determined that <i>he</i> shall not want for advantages; but, as I have a
certain sort of squeamishness about a person taking oaths that he does
not know the meaning of, and swearing to observe statutes of whose
nature he is unaware, I sent to Oxford for a copy of the University
Statutes, that I might run my eye over them, and see what were the laws
that governed the noble, the great, the famous, the&#8212;in short, the
enlightened place, the University of Oxford. The book is now before
me:&#8212;'<i>Parecbolæ sive Excerpta e corpore Statutorum Universitatis
Oxoniensis</i>:' and a copy is, I believe, presented to every
undergraduate
at his matriculation, that he may be fully aware of the laws that he has
sworn to obey. The Statutes I find to be written in a Latin form&#8212;I
cannot say, in a <i>dead</i> language, for it is of a kind very much
resembling the living, and of that description vulgarly termed 'Dog'
Latin; so that I, who never got further than <i>Eutropius</i>, and whose
acquaintance with the language has become rusty from want of use, can
easily make out a translation of the sentences. I find that my son will
have to sign the Thirty-nine Articles, which, I dare say, is all very
proper; take the Oath of Allegiance, which is quite right; and also, the
Oath of Supremacy, in which he will have to say, that he, <span
class="smcap">Peterloo
Brown</span>, does, 'from his heart, abhor, detest, and abjure, as
impious and
heretical, that damnable doctrine and position that Princes,
excommunicated or deprived by the <span class="smcap">Pope</span>, or
any authority of the See of
Rome, may be deposed or murdered by their subjects, or any other
whatsoever.' Now, although I may be secretly of opinion that my lad
might as well swear to any Bosh, as all this about the excommunicate
Princes, yet I pass this over, and proceed to the Statutes themselves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nobody shall Wear any other Clothes than those of
 a Black
or Subfusk Hue.</span></p>
</div>

<p>"I find that a great part of the book is about the keeping of terms;
the
granting of various kinds of degrees, of congregations, convocations,
dispensations, and all that sort of thing; and I then come&#8212;under the
head '<i>Tit.</i> XIV. <i>De Vestitu et Habitu Scholastico</i>'&#8212;to the
Statutes
that more immediately concern my son <span class="smcap">Peterloo</span>.
 And this is the result of
my search.</p>

<p>"I find that nobody, unless he is a Peer's son&#8212;(who may do what he
likes, for you will find, <i>Mr. Punch</i>, that it is one of the great
beauties of our University system, that it allows no distinction of
persons, but puts the sons of the ignoble and the noble on equal terms;
but I am digressing!)&#8212;I find '<i>Statutum est</i>,' that 'Nobody shall
wear
any other clothes than those of a black, or "subfusk" colour' (<i>coloris
nigri
 aut subfusci</i>), 'or imitate (in their dress) what is extravagant
or fast:' (that seems to be the meaning of the words '<i>fastum aut
luxum</i>;' but, as I said before, my Latin is rather rusty). Now, since
this is the rule, I would ask how it is, <i>Mr. Punch</i>, that young
<span class="smcap">Bellingham Grey</span> (my neighbour's son) should,
at the end of every term,
bring home from Christ Church (where by the way, he is ruining his
father, but that is no affair of <i>mine</i>!) suits of clothes of every
colour <i>but</i> black or 'subfusk' (not that I exactly know what
colour
that may be), and remarkable solely for their extravagance and
'fast-ness?' I want my lad to dress like a gentleman, but I don't always
want to see him putting in an appearance like an undertaker, or
counter-skipper, or like the man in the play (is it <i>Hamlet</i>?
though,
probably, <i>Othello</i>?) continually clothed in 'an inky suit of
black.'
And, if he swears to observe such a Statute as the above, why, <i>of
course</i>, the authorities will see that he obeys it, and dresses
accordingly.</p>

<p>"It is next ordered, that 'Nobody shall follow that absurd and proud
custom of walking in boots in public.' (<i>Insuper, ab absurdo illo et
fastuoso publice in ocreis ambulandi more, abstinere compellantur.</i> I
give you the very words, <i>Mr. Punch</i>, lest you should not believe
me.)
Now, where on earth is the harm of my lad wearing Wellingtons? But I
suppose that every one in Oxford (I do not know the place) wears the
'Oxford Shoes,' and that this Statute has been inserted to keep up what
is, doubtless, the staple trade of the city. For, <i>of course</i>, the
Statute is observed, or they would not make the students swear to obey
it.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 25%;">

 Proud Custom of
walking in Boots in Public." width="100%" /></a>
<p><span class="smcap">Nobody shall follow that Absurd and Proud Custom
of
walking in Boots in Public.</span></p>
</div>

<p>"'<i>Statutum est</i>' also, that 'Nobody shall wear the hair long or
 in
curls (<i>in capillitio modus est, nec concinnos, aut comam nimis
promissam alant</i>). Now, Sir, my son <span class="smcap">Peterloo</span>
 has been favoured by Nature
with a particularly curly head of hair. I wish to ask you, Do you think
that this misfortune, which it is evident can be from no fault of his
own, will shut him out from all the privileges of the University? It is
a momentous question for a father to make, and one which may interest
the bosom friend of the present Chancellor&#8212;I mean <span class="smcap">Mr.</span>&#8212;I
 beg his
pardon, <span class="smcap">Dr. Disraeli</span>. One thing is plain:
that the advertisements of 'Do
you want luxurious hair?' can be of no use in Oxford, and that
bears'-grease must be at a discount. And if my son <span class="smcap">Peterloo</span>
 should fail
to observe any of the above Statutes touching his personal appearance,
or the giving himself airs, he will, when he is a graduate, have to pay
6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> for each offence (<i>p&oelig;na</i> 6<i>s.</i> <i>et</i>
 8<i>d.</i> <i>plectatur,
toties quoties</i>), and while he is an undergraduate he will, for such
offences, have to suffer corporal punishment (<i>p&oelig;na corporali</i>).
 Good
gracious, <i>Mr. Punch</i>, I have read that the great <span
class="smcap">Newton</span> was horsed when
he was a Cambridge undergraduate; but I thought that such a degrading
custom was either confined to that University, or had passed away with
the dark ages, and oil-lamps, and Protection, and all that sort of
thing. Does not Oxford&#8212;the Mother of Science, and (for what I know) the
Aunt of Literature, and the Grandmother of the Arts&#8212;does not Oxford, I
repeat, keep up with the progressive enlightenment of the age? I almost
repent that I have entered <span class="smcap">Peterloo</span> there (at
 St. Vitus' College), and I
tremble to think of the effect that corporal punishment, will have on
him when he is become a <i>man</i>. As an Eton boy it (perhaps) does him
good; but as a man! I thought such disgrace only attached to the army.
For, <i>of course</i>, the corporal punishment cannot be inflicted <i>only</i>
 in
the Statutes.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 25%;">

in Curls." width="100%" /></a>
<p><span class="smcap">Nobody shall wear the hair Long or in Curls.</span></p>
</div>

<p>"I then find that it is '<i>Statutum est</i>,' that if any one should
 happen
to introduce a new and unwonted style of dress, that the Vice-Chancellor
and the Heads of the Colleges and Halls shall thereupon hold
deliberation and give their opinion; and that the Vice-Chancellor shall
then forbid the cutters-out and the tailors, making these kind of<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
garments (<i>Deinde, Vice-Cancellarius scissoribus sive sartoribus
vestiariis hujusmodi vestes conficiendi potestate interdicat</i>); and
that
the Heads shall prohibit their scholars from wearing them; but that if
the young men, with a morbid pertinacity (<i>morbi pertinacia</i>),
persist
in clothing themselves in the aforesaid garments, the Vice-Chancellor
shall, after three monitions, expel them.</p>

<p>"The motherly care shown by Alma Mater that her sons should not fall
into scrapes by making Guys of themselves, is here very strongly
evidenced; and I think it would be a profitable subject for inquiry, if
<span class="smcap">Mr. Hume</span> would move for a return of the
number of times that the
Vice-Chancellor and the Heads of Houses have met, in accordance with the
above Statute.</p>

<p>"The remainder of <i>Tit.</i> XIV is taken up with the cut of the
gowns, &amp;c.,
but is as unlike a ladylike page of <i>Le Follet</i> (which <span
class="smcap">Mrs. Brown</span> takes
in) as anything can be.</p>

<p>"The Statutes demanding attention in <i>Tit.</i> XV. are so numerous
that I
will trouble you with them in another letter; but they are so amusing
that they will repay perusal, and your opinion upon them will not only
be highly valued by, but of the greatest use, to</p>

<h2>SPHERES OF REAL USEFULNESS.</h2>

<p>The subjoined advertisement relates to an exhibition, which is,
perhaps,
somewhat interesting, and which might be rendered very much so:&#8212;</p>

<blockquote><p>DIORAMA OF CHRISTIAN MISSIONS, 32, Sloane Street, will
continue open
for a short time. Parents will find this a truly Christian
exhibition for their children. Tahiti&#8212;New Zealand&#8212;The
Maori&#8212;Island of Tanna&#8212;Death of Captain Cook&#8212;First Missionary
House at Tahiti&#8212;Cape Coast Castle&#8212;Banyan Tree&#8212;Ashanti&#8212;Missionary
Tombs&#8212;The Dungeon, and Rose Madiai.</p></blockquote>

<p>What this exhibition wants, in order that it may enlist the
sympathies
of those who are the most earnest promoters of Missionary enterprise, is
the addition of a few views of certain savage and heathen regions, the
conversion and civilisation of whose inhabitants are more particularly
important to the British public. The New Cut, Ratcliff Highway,
Houndsditch, Whitechapel, and the slums of Westminster, afford fields
for the operation of preachers and philanthropists as extensive, as
remarkable, and as unknown as the Polynesian Archipelago or the Cannibal
Islands.</p>

<h2>WHAT IS A MILE?</h2>

<p>We think that the question of "What is a Mile?"&#8212;a question which
promises to swallow up in interest the Eastern Question, and all other
questions which as yet remain unanswered&#8212;should be settled as soon as
possible; for, until it is settled, we shall never be able to arrive at
a proper settlement of the Cab fares. This settlement is due&#8212;not only
to the persons who ride in cabs&#8212;but to those who drive them, for there
are so many varieties of a mile, and so many different ways of measuring
it, that it is impossible to say which is the right one. For instance&#8212;</p>

<p>If a young lady walks round the corner of the street in which she
lives,
she comes home quite fatigued, and "is sure she has walked more than a
mile."</p>

<p>If a husband is dragged&#8212;a little against his will&#8212;to a certain street
where there happens to be a bonnet shop, though it is not more than
twenty yards, he is morally certain "he has been taken a mile out of his
way, if he has been taken an inch."</p>

<p>It is curious the number of miles a mother-in-law has walked when she
feels desirous, poor creature, of having a cab.</p>

<p>Besides, miles vary so much. A mistress's mile is generally very
different to a servant's&#8212;a master's to a clerk's. Auctioneers' miles
are proverbially very short ones when they are describing a property as
being not more than "an omnibus distance from town," or when they are
enlarging upon the merits of a Villa that is "only an easy drive from a
railway station." Travellers' miles, on the contrary, are generally very
long ones. You will hear a delicate young man, who has just returned
from a pedestrian tour, boast of having walked his "two thousand miles,"
just as if he had trailed a pedometer behind him, and had measured every
inch of the road. Panoramas also, have a very elastic method of
stretching out a mile, which cab-drivers would doubtlessly not object to
adopt as their own particular standard of measurement. They talk very
glibly of being "three miles long," whereas, if the distance came to be
measured, it would probably turn out to be&#8212;like cabmen's distances
generally&#8212;not more than half. There is another deficiency, too, that
frequently occurs with the mileage question. We have known a distance,
that when a party first went over it, was only four or five miles,
become suddenly increased to eight or ten at least, when the same
party&#8212;especially if a dinner party&#8212;had to go over it again on their
way back. This difficulty has been felt so strongly at times, that every
one of the party has preferred&#8212;at that late hour&#8212;stopping where he
was, instead of walking home all that distance. These unnecessary
difficulties imperatively call for a speedy answer to the puzzling
question, "What is a Mile?" for hitherto the question has been passed
over by our Police magistrates, from one parish to another, like a
pauper, for the want of a settlement.</p>

<h2>EXHIBITION OF POLITICAL INDUSTRY.</h2>

<p>The honourable and gallant Member for Lincoln has reason for
complaining
that there is no prospect of the outlay upon the New Houses of
Parliament being finished. The outlay will not be finished before the
Houses are&#8212;Victoria Tower and all; and when we see what progress is
being made with the Crystal Palace at Sydenham, we cannot but think how
desirable it is that those edifices, and, indeed, the whole
Parliamentary concern should have been got up by a Houses of Parliament
Company. If that had been the case, the edifices would not only have
been long since lighted, ventilated, and decorated, but the thing would
now be a paying property. Such it might easily have been rendered by
making the galleries larger, and admitting the public at so much a
head&#8212;say playhouse prices&#8212;which crowded audiences doubtless would be
willing to give, in order to hear the spouting. Besides, the Members
might have been required to pay for their seats, and the revelations
that have taken place this session before the Election Committees afford
sufficient assurance that they would have done that handsomely.</p>

<p>We suppose that the principal objection of the Irish priesthood to
the

is, that if the pupils were allowed to have the truth of Christianity

<h2>OUR HONEYMOON.</h2>

<p>TUESDAY&#8212;MAY 28, 18&#8212;,</p>

<p>Shall I ever forget the day? As it comes round&#8212;if I'm spared for
fifty
years&#8212;I'm sure I shall always feel a chill, a pang at the thoughts of
it. That dear, foolish creature, <span class="smcap">Fred</span>! As if
being shot could make it
any better! And then the thought&#8212;the horrid thought would press
itself&#8212;piercing like a dagger&#8212;to be sent into weeds in one's very
Honeymoon!</p>

<p>Of course, the whole house was raised. When <span class="smcap">Josephine</span>
 heard me scream,
and came to the bedroom door, and found it locked, and couldn't make me
sensible to open it&#8212;for I'd the key in my hand, and so had dropt it on
the floor when I fell myself in a swoon&#8212;</p>

<p>Of course, when <span class="smcap">Josephine</span> could make
nobody hear, she very soon raised
the house, and there were chambermaids and waiters at the door, and they
were breaking it open, when I came enough to myself to prevent it!</p>

<p>"It's all right, Ma'am," said <span class="smcap">Josephine</span>.
"Master's safe: not a whit the
worse, depend on't."</p>

<p>"Safe! Are you sure?"&#8212;</p>

<p>"Certain, Ma'am. 'Cause the landlord has given information to the
constables, and no doubt on it, he says, they'll all be in custody afore
they can shoot one another."</p>

<p>"Shoot!" Well&#8212;- for the moment&#8212;I did hate the creature as she spoke
the word; speaking it with all the coolness in life&#8212;death, I <i>might</i>
say.</p>

<p>I hastily slipped something on: went into our room. Had up the
landlord,
the landlady; and it really was wonderful&#8212;gave me for the time quite a
shock at human nature&#8212;to see how little they were moved&#8212;in fact not
moved at all&#8212;by my wretchedness, my downright misery. "Oh," I thought,
every other minute, "if I once get him home again!" And then the next
moment, some horrid sight would come before me&#8212;and no one, no one to
help or advise me. Yes. The landlady counselled me to have a cup of tea,
and the landlord advised me to make myself comfortable. "Things o' the
sort"&#8212;he said&#8212;"never come to nothing, now-a-days. Besides, he'd given
the word to the constables&#8212;and I might make myself easy they'd all be
locked up in a jiffy."</p>

<p>"Could he tell me"&#8212;I asked&#8212;"the most likely road to take?"</p>

<p>"Why, no," he said, "some folks took one, some another. Some liked
the
cliffs, some the Devil's Dyke; but as he'd sent all ways, why, again he
assured me, I had nothing to do but to make myself comfortable."</p>

<p>And even as the horrid man said this, his more dreadful wife&#8212;not but
what the woman meant well; only I couldn't abide her for her composure
at such a time&#8212;the woman came to me stirring a cup of tea with, as she
said, just a spoonful of brandy in it to settle my spirits.</p>

<p>What a thought! I to take tea with brandy in it, and <span
class="smcap">Frederick</span> perhaps
at that moment&#8212;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Josephine</span>&#8212;I'll do the girl so much justice
 at last&#8212;was running to and
fro, upstairs and downstairs&#8212;and putting the house, from one end to the
other, in a ferment. At last the landlady desired her to be quiet, and
not go about making noise enough to tear people out of their beds. If
all the world was gone out to be shot, that was no reason why their
house should be ruined!</p>

<p>Well, I won't attempt to describe the two hours I suffered! How,
sometimes, I thought I'd have a horse and go galloping anywhere,
everywhere.</p>

<p>"It's all over, Ma'am!"&#8212;cried <span class="smcap">Josephine</span>,
running in.</p>

<p>"Over!" and I saw death in the girl's face.</p>

<p>"Over, Ma'am. They fired two shots, Ma'am&#8212;two a-piece&#8212;they say, and"&#8212;</p>

<p>"Yes&#8212;yes"&#8212;</p>

<p>"And master"&#8212;</p>

<p>"Killed!"&#8212;I screamed.</p>

<p>"No, Ma'am! Quite the reverse!"&#8212;</p>

<p>(How I thanked the girl for the words, though where <i>could</i> she
have
picked 'em up?)</p>

<p>"He has not killed his&#8212;I mean the&#8212;other gentleman?"&#8212;</p>

<p>"No, Ma'am, totally the contrary. Nobody's hit&#8212;not so much as winged,
though what that means I can't say&#8212;only I heard one of the men say as
much. But all of 'em in custody."</p>

<p>"What now? Why, what for?&#8212;"</p>

<p>"Why, Ma'am, as I hear, for every one of the gentlemen to be bound
over
to keep his peace for the rest of his born days! And la! bless me&#8212;how
ill you turn, Ma'am, and when it's all over?"</p>

<p>"Not at all, <span class="smcap">Josephine</span>. I'm very well,
now: very well, indeed,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
and
then rose my determination. Yes, I'd go home that very day. "<span
class="smcap">Josephine</span>,
pack up as much as you can. Your master shall go home, I'll take care of
<i>that</i> directly."</p>

<p>"That's right, Ma'am. Now you've got him safe and sound once more,
you
couldn't do better, Ma'am. And for <span class="smcap">Mr. Truepenny</span>"&#8212;</p>

<p>Well, his very name set me in a flame. "<span class="smcap">Mr.
Truepenny</span>! He never crosses
<i>my</i> threshold! A very pretty friend indeed, to come and lure a
man&#8212;a
newly-married man"&#8212;</p>

<p>"Not married a month yet, quite, Ma'am," said <span class="smcap">Josephine</span>,
 "which makes it
hard."&#8212;</p>

<p>"And take him out, I may say, in cold blood"&#8212;</p>

<p>"Which makes it ten times wickeder," said <span class="smcap">Josephine</span>.</p>

<p>"And butcher him like a lamb," said I.</p>

<p>"Exactly like a lamb, Ma'am," cried the girl. "Only there is this
difference, Ma'am: you know master isn't a bit hurt."</p>

<p>"That has nothing to do with it. He might have been killed, and what
would <span class="smcap">Mr. Truepenny</span> have cared? No! I might
have been left a wretched
widow!"</p>

<p>"And much <span class="smcap">Mr. Truepenny</span> would have helped
you then, Ma'am," said the
good girl.</p>

<p>"No, he never crosses the <i>Flitch</i>&#8212;never: and that I shall tell
your
master. The foolish, dear fellow! How I will scold him."</p>

<p>"Do, Ma'am; he deserves it all. To go fighting and&#8212;and after all, do
you know for a certainty what he went fighting about?"&#8212;</p>

<p>"Folly, madness, of course," said I. "Jealous of"&#8212;</p>

<p>"Well, I thought so!" cried <span class="smcap">Josephine</span>,
with a strange knowing look. "I
thought as much. Jealous, and of you, too, above all folks! And in your
Honeymoon, too. Well, I'm sure; as if there wasn't time enough for
that!"</p>

<p>"I don't mean to say jealous; not of me&#8212;of course not. But the fact
is,
he fired up at a rudeness, a liberty that"&#8212;</p>

<p>"You don't say so, Ma'am!" cried the girl. "La, and if you please,
how
was that?"</p>

<p>"Why, it was all folly&#8212;all nonsense&#8212;and he ought to have known
better;
but&#8212;there was a little flower-girl on the beach. What's the matter,
<span class="smcap">Josephine</span>?" for I saw the creature look
suddenly confused.</p>

<p>"Nothing, Ma'am&#8212;only I&#8212;I once saw that girl&#8212;a gipsey-girl,
Ma'am&#8212;with flowers, Ma'am; yes, to be sure."</p>

<p>"Then you know her?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Can't say I know. Because one should hardly lower oneself to know a
creature of that sort. Only once, and perhaps twice, I've had a nosegay
of her."</p>

<p>"Well, she <i>would</i> give a nosegay to me," said I.</p>

<p>"Just like 'em, Ma'am," replied <span class="smcap">Josephine</span>.</p>

<p>"Yes. She ran to me, and put a nosegay in my hand. And in that
nosegay,
what, <span class="smcap">Josephine</span>&#8212;(and I watched her narrowly
as I further
questioned)&#8212;what do you think there was?"</p>

<p>"Law! Who can answer for the gipsies," cried <span class="smcap">Josephine</span>.</p>

<p>"Well, then, there was a letter&#8212;a love-letter; and that letter
finding
its way to your master's hand"&#8212;</p>

<p>"Oh, Ma'am! <i>Do</i> forgive me! Pray forgive me! I couldn't help
it; but I
see it all now. The gentleman <i>would</i> write&#8212;that letter was not for
you!"&#8212;</p>

<p>"No? For whom then?"&#8212;</p>

<p>"If you please, Ma'am, and you'll not be angry, that letter"&#8212;said the
bold creature&#8212;"that letter was for me!"&#8212;</p>

<p>"For <i>you</i>! And here has nearly been murder done&#8212;here has your
master"&#8212;</p>

<p>But at the moment <span class="smcap">Fred</span> ran into the room,
and I was in his arms.</p>

<h2>THE MILESTONE TREADMILL.</h2>

<p>How to find fit work for convicts&#8212;work that shall at the same time be
serviceable to the Public, and shall not take the bread out of the
mouths of honest men&#8212;is a question that nobody has yet answered.
Profound philosophers have sometimes got very near to the discovery of
the quadrature of the circle, perpetual motion, the transmutation of
metals, the elixir of life, the crystallisation of carbon, the
longitude. They have almost succeeded; all but solved the problem; when,
just on the verge of the accomplishment of the great work, they find all
their profound calculations upset by some petty, superficial obstacle
which they had overlooked. Precisely thus had we nearly attained to the
invention of a proper employment for convicted thieves: just so were we
confounded on the brink of success by a stumbling-block, which has
tripped us up and flung us back again heels over head, alighting,
however, on the former, as we always do.</p>

<p>A communication in the <i>Civil Service Gazette</i> states the case
of a
letter-carrier, in the Derby district, who has to walk above 20 miles a
day, and deliver letters at eleven villages. This amount of walking
exercise, allowing 15 minutes for delivery at each village, and 25
minutes for refreshment, the writer calculates to be 8 miles an hour for
2&#189; hours. It reads like an achievement of running a fabulous distance
and picking up an incredible number of stones with the mouth. That a man
might match himself to attempt such a feat of pedestrianism for a
limited period and high stakes is conceivable: but this one does it
daily for 11s. Of course he has sent in his resignation; no free agent
could continue to do such work on such terms. Only eleven shillings for
all this hard labour!</p>

<p>Hard labour. These two words are brilliantly suggestive&#8212;seem to flash
upon us the settlement of the convict employment question. Hard
labour&#8212;occupation toilsome and unremunerative; at the same time useful:
just the proper occupation for criminals. Rig out all our rogues and
thieves in blue and scarlet, turn them into postmen, and give them six
months, or upwards, of 8 miles an hour for several hours daily
letter-carrying. <span class="smcap">Mercury</span> in Windsor uniform;
messenger and thief in one:
on the turnpike treadmill&#8212;'tis a pretty idea, too, into the bargain.</p>

<p>But here up starts the difficulty. It is peculiarly necessary that a
postman should, before all things, be honest. By this trifling obstacle
is the magnificently specious scheme of substituting Post Office
employment for the treadmill frustrated. The mounted police, and other
constabulary, might prevent the fellows from escaping, and keep them in
their routes; but could hardly hinder them from secreting money and
notes in stumps of trees, old walls, and other nooks and corners, for
concealment therein till the expiration of their sentences. Whilst,
however, there exists this objection to the employment of rogues as
postmen, there is nothing whatever to forbid them from employing
themselves in that capacity. Hence the frequent abstraction of
half-sovereigns from letters; taxing the detective acumen of <span class="smcap">Mr.
Sculthorpe</span>.</p>

<p>We see that a bumpkin of a Post Office messenger was tried the other day
at the assizes for making away with letters. He was an ignorant clown:
and he destroyed them simply that he might not have the trouble of
delivering them. Alas for our economy! Unfortunately we can't give
inadequate wages without being in danger of getting either a knave for
our servant or a fool.</p>

<p>So we didn't quite set the Thames on fire; it won't do to make
letter-carriers of convicts: and as to the nuisance of having knaves and
fools amongst our postmen, there is evidently no help for that but to
raise the postmen's salaries.</p>

<hr />

<h4>Devotees in Cells.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Lucas</span>, the other evening, made a
reasonable speech in the House. He
complained that the principle of religious equality, in English prisons,
was not sufficiently observed with regard to Roman Catholic prisoners. A
fair ground of complaint! By all means let every Romanist convict enjoy
his own conviction.</p>

<h2>AN ANSWER TO THE EASTERN QUESTION.</h2>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/072.png" alt="T" class="cap" width="10%" />

<p class="cap_3">THIS question is, at last, effectively answered. We are
 glad to announce
that <i>Constantinople has just been taken by</i> <span class="smcap">Messers.
 Grieve</span> and <span class="smcap">Telbin</span>,
who, dead to the influence of Russian gold, refuse to surrender it, upon
any terms, into the hands of the <span class="smcap">Emperor Nicholas</span>.
 They intend to hold
out as long as they possibly can; but all English subjects will be
admitted to view its numerous beauties by applying at the Gallery of
Illustration, in Regent Street.</p>
</div>

<p>No Russians need apply.</p>

<hr />

<h4>Walls have Tears.</h4>

<p>A complaint against damp houses has been recently made by a
letter-writer in the <i>Times</i>, who says he has suffered severely
from wet
walls. We are happy in suggesting an efficient remedy by recommending
that the walls of new houses should be papered with Parliamentary
speeches, the usual dryness of which would, we are convinced, render any
little dampness impossible.</p>

<hr />

<h2>PASSPORTS IMPROVED.</h2>

<p>There was a talk of passports being issued with photographic
portraits.
Men may not object to this plan, as they do not care so much for a
little disfigurement, but we doubt strongly if ladies will ever give
their countenances to it. It is well known that photographic portraits
do not improve the beauty of any one. They give the features of the
"human face divine," but without the slightest touch of flattery. Worse
than this, if there should be any little defect, the cruel metal does
not trouble itself in the least to conceal it, but has the vulgarity to
render it in all its staring obliquity or deformity. We have our fears,
therefore, that this very unfashionable system of portrait painting will
never suit the ladies. It goes upon the Antipodean theory of making the
pretty faces appear ugly, and the ugly ones still uglier. We are
confident that no lady who has any respect for herself, or her husband,
will face such an ordeal. Some other plan must be invented by the
police, or else there will be an end to all travelling on the part of
our ladies.</p>

<p>Where is the woman who would care about going abroad, when she was
liable to be stopped at every minute, and forced to produce, for the
amusement of some coarse gensd'arme, an ugly photographic portrait of
herself? We propose, therefore, that the following system be
adopted:&#8212;Let <span class="smcap">M. Baugniet</span>, or some other
artist as clever in taking
portraits, be constantly in attendance at the passport office. He would
strike off a likeness in a very short time&#8212;such a likeness as,
delicately flattered, the lady herself would take a positive pleasure in
producing every time she was asked for it. It would be an elegant work
of art; which the lady would like, probably, to preserve by her, and the
possession of which would also materially enhance the pleasures of
travelling. All the expenses to be paid, of course, by the State&#8212;for it
would be a most ungracious action to ask a lady to pay for her own
portrait&#8212;or else to be defrayed by the railways, or steam-packets, of
the country which the fair traveller intended to visit. The companies
would be amply repaid by the influx of passengers, besides having the
enviable privilege of claiming copies of all their female visitors. An
ample profit, even, might be realized by selling the lithographs, for a
lady might be allowed to claim as many copies of her likeness as she
pleased, upon the understanding that all copies, beyond the one which
was <i>given</i> to her for the necessary police purposes of travelling,
 were
to be paid for. A large revenue might be derived from this branch of the
passport system, for what lady would hesitate to take a hundred copies
of herself, if she was made extremely handsome?</p>

<h2>The Vegetarians in the North.</h2>

<p>The Vegetarians have been consuming a quantity of green stuff in
public
at the Town Hall of Salford. We shall expect soon to hear of a variety
of Extraordinary Feats performed by geniuses of the Vegetarian class,
such as swallowing turnips whole, demolishing spinach by the sieve,
onions by the rope, and cabbages by the cartload. We perceive that the
Vegetarians have set themselves in opposition to everything like
compromise; and a poor unfortunate who endeavoured to meet the
Vegetarians half way by living on tapioca, was recently hooted down, and
warned of the frightful consequences to be apprehended from the starch
in the tapioca, which might lead to stiffness of the joints, and a
thousand other maladies.</p>

<h2>SPECIAL REVIEW OF THE FLEET.</h2>

<center>(<i>By a Distinct Observer.</i>)</center>

<p>I had the advantage of inspecting the Review of the Fleet from a
peculiar point of view. Before me was an enormous volume of smoke, which
completely prevented me from seeing the vessels; it was, however, a
volume in which I think I read something to the purpose.</p>

<p>There is, perhaps, hardly any mind wherein the tremendous roar of
1,076
guns, the smallest of which are 32 pounders, and the largest throw 68
lb. shot and 84 lb. shells, would not excite some degree of emotion of
some sort.</p>

<p>The boom of each Brobdignagian piece of ordnance inspired me with a
sum
in mental arithmetic, which the immediate thunder of another explosion
prevented me from carrying out with strict accuracy. The problem,
however, was simple enough. So much noise, so much gunpowder, so much
money. So much money; so much taxation. The scene&#8212;of smoke chiefly&#8212;was
too sublime; the noise was too overwhelming; perhaps I had also drunk
too much brandy and water: to admit of my <span class="smcap">Cockering</span>
 myself in exact
calculation; but I ciphered roughly in a mental soliloquy, thus:&#8212;</p>

<p>Bang! There goes the Income Tax. Bang! That's the Succession Duty.
Bang!
Bang! That's the Stamp and Paper Duties. Bang! Bang! Bang! There's the
Assessed Taxes. Bom! the Malt Tax. Pop! the Wine Duties. Pop-pop-pop!
The rest of the Taxes on Consumption.</p>

<p>All this money gone in fire and smoke? Not so&#8212;the greater part of it,
doubtless in national defence and Peace Assurance; but is it not just
possible that a rather enthusiastic nation may get a little too fond&#8212;as
it has been ere now&#8212;of gunpowder and artillery; a little too prone, if
it does not take care&#8212;no disparagement to Chobham Camps and Spithead
Reviews&#8212;to amuse itself by playing at soldiers and sailors.</p>

<p>Of course it is necessary, to a certain extent, to discharge small
arms
and to fire broadsides at nothing. But yet, "amid the joy and the
uproar" of these imposing high jinks, it may be a useful exercise for
the mind of the spectator, if not too much clouded by powder smoke, or
other fumes, to count the cost of the cartridges, and compute the
dimensions of the hole which they blow in our pocket.</p>

now and then exhibiting symptoms of restlessness. The distinguished

<h2>WHO SENDS ALL THE CONSCIENCE-MONEY?</h2>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/075.png" alt="P" class="cap" width="30%" />

<p class="cap_3">THERE is a question we would ask the reader: Did ever
he meet with a
person who had sent any "conscience-money" to the <span class="smcap">Chancellor
 of the
Exchequer</span>? We have met with many curious people in our lifetime,
but we
must say we never came in contact with an eccentric individual, who
indulged in any peculiarity half so strange as the above. We do not
believe such an individual exists. If ever there was a myth, we should
say that individual is fairly entitled to call himself one. He must be
the myth of all myths; unless perchance it is the <span class="smcap">Chancellor
 of the
Exchequer</span> himself, who sends all these conscience-moneys. We have
 long
had a suspicion of this nature; firstly, because we never see any return
of these numerous sums of money entered in the Quarter's Revenue; and,
secondly, because we believe he does it to decoy others to do the same.
If you notice, these conscientious offerings are generally made in
favour of the income-tax. Now, the <span class="smcap">Chancellor of the
 Exchequer</span> knows
very well that this tax is not a popular one. He also knows that, on
account of its unpopularity, there is a very large class of <span
class="smcap">Her
Majesty's</span> subjects who particularly dislike paying it. Give them
but a
chance of evading the payment, and they do not in the least scruple
availing themselves of it. We do not say whether the practice, so
pursued, is honest or not, but such is the fact! The <span class="smcap">Chancellor
 of the
Exchequer</span>, therefore, hits every now and then upon the
"conscience-money" expedient in order to reproach every man who has been
a defaulter with the fact of his non-payment. It is only another way of
saying to him, "Why don't you follow his example? Look at A. B.; what a
noble-minded fellow he is! By some accident he has neglected to pay £50
for his share of the Income-Tax, and here, by Jove, he has sent it! Now,
if <i>you</i> have any conscience, you will immediately do the same."</p>
</div>

<p>We cannot say whether any one does send anything. A few pounds may
drop
in occasionally, but we suspect that the majority of the sums, sent in
the name of A. B., or X. Y. Z., and the other popular initials of the
alphabet, are forwarded by the <span class="smcap">Chancellor of the
Exchequer</span> himself. It
is a financial dodge for inducing reluctant tax-payers to do that as a
matter of "conscience," which they will not do as a pleasure.</p>

<hr />

<h4>THE END OF QUACKERY.</h4>

<p>Among the many novel systems of medicine for which the present day is
remarkable, there is one distinguished by a name that, at least, seems
very appropriate. It is called Coffinism. This is candid. The term,
however, is so comprehensive, that it might, with great correctness, be
applied to all manner of therapeutical schemes which deviate from true
medical science. There is one right method of treating diseases, and
there are many wrong ones; to all whereof the denomination of Coffinism
is justly applicable; since it indicates, with exactness, the tendency
of each of them; every improper way of attempting to cure people being a
path which leads to the "bourne from which no traveller returns:" in
short, which terminates in the elm box.</p>

Russia's</span> Ultimatums, or
Ultimata, just as you like to call it. We trust the <span class="smcap">Emperor</span>

<h2>MR. PETERLOO BROWN'S EXAMINATION OF THE OXFORD STATUTES.</h2>

<center>LETTER II.</center>

<p class="salute">"<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Punch,</span></p>

<p>"In my last letter to you, I mentioned a few of the <i>Statutum ests</i>
 of
'<i>Tit.</i> XIV.' of the Oxford Statutes; and I now come to consider '<i>Tit.</i>
XV.' of the same amusing work, premising that I shall confine my remarks
to this <i>Tit.</i>, as it would be a task of insufferable weariness&#8212;and
one, I suppose, which like the discovery of the source of the Nile, no
philanthropist would ever live to carry out&#8212;to attempt to explore the
twenty-one <i>Tits.</i>, which, with their <i>appendices</i> branches,
run through
that immense tract of paper intended for the use of the academic youth
(<i>in usum juventutis academicaæ</i>). But I may remark, <i>en passant</i>,
 as
our 'lively neighbours' say&#8212;(I don't know French, <i>Mr. Punch</i>, but I
like to quote it occasionally, as it shows refinement and education, and
that you read the <i>Morning Post</i>, and all that sort of thing)&#8212;I may
remark, that for the Vice-Chancellor to drive twenty-one of these
<i>Tits.</i> in hand, and keep them well together, must be no ordinary
act of
<span class="smcap">Jehu</span>-ism; and I think it would have added
greatly to the effect of the
late Commemoration, if they had put out illustrated posters, that the
new Chancellor, 'acknowledged by the Press to be the premier jockey of
the day, and without a Peer in the Westminster Circle,' would make his
'first public entrance into Oxford, driving <span class="smcap">TWENTY-ONE
 TITS IN HAND!</span>'
after which would, of course, follow 'the performances in the Theatre,'
with 'the drolleries of the Caucasian Clown,' and 'the laughable farce
of <i>The Phenomenon in a Doctor's gown.'</i> I think something might
have
been made of that; but the hint may perhaps be taken against the next
opportunity.</p>

<p>"<i>Tit.</i> XV. treats '<i>De moribus conformandis</i>;" and it
first orders that
all juniors should pay due respect to their seniors&#8212;their seniors that
is, in academical rank, for age does <i>not</i> come before dignity in
Oxford&#8212;the undergraduates to the B.A.'s, the B.A.'s to the M.A.'s, the
M.A.'s to the D.C.L.'s, and so on, according to the standing of the 'Man
of letters;' (a phrase which evidently refers to those mysterious
decimations of the alphabet, which some people delight to put after
their names). And the 'due respect' is to be shown, firstly, by yielding
up the best seats, (<i>locum potiorem cedendo</i>) which, they tell me,
was
done in the theatre at the late Commemoration, by putting the
undergraduates in the gallery, the M.A.'s in the pit, and reserving the
boxes and dress circle for the 'Dons' and the ladies; and secondly, by
giving the wall, and by capping, or, as the Statute more expressively<span
 class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
says, 'by uncovering the head at a proper distance,' (<i>ad justum
intervallum caput aperiendo</i>) though what this proper distance may
be,
appears to be left to the taste of the capper, the rank of the cappee,
the force of the wind, the length of the arm, or any other directing
influence. Probably the distance is measured by the relative dignity of
the wearers of the cap, so that an undergraduate would have to uncover
himself as soon as the Vice-Chancellor came in sight; and, in the event
of a dispute as to the proper distance, the matter would probably be
settled as they arrange similar differences of opinion under the new Cab
Act, and would be brought before the Vice-Chancellor's Court, who would,
doubtless, order the distance to be measured. At any rate, it appears
that my son <span class="smcap">Peterloo</span> will have to learn to
keep his distance, and this
inclines me to think favourably of this Statute; for I have always been
of opinion (since I made money by it) that there is nothing like being
'umble' to your superiors, and showing them all that respect which they
desire, even if they don't deserve. But I am glad that the Oxford
authorities enforce this Statute by wisely ordaining that those who
neglect the proper marks of respect, shall be punished with impositions,
loss of terms, and the setting down of their names in the Proctor's
Black Book, (<i>in Libro Nigro Procuratorum</i>), which I have no doubt
is
the Bogy with which the nurses of Alma Mater terrify and awe her
refractory children. But moreover, if they should still contumaciously
persist in their conduct, (<i>si contumaces perstiterint</i>), they
shall be
fined in addition, not more than five pounds for each offence. It does
not say what is done with the money, but it probably goes towards
purchasing a plaister for wounded dignity. Now, <i>Mr. Punch</i>, as
touching
this healthy Statute, I am rather curious to know how many
undergraduates, B.A.'s, or M.A.'s, were, during the late Commemoration,
castigated by the Proctors (<i>Procuratoribus castigentur</i>), or fined
 this
five pounds, or had their names put down in that terrible Black Book, or
done anything else to, for not capping at a proper distance, or yielding
the wall to <span class="smcap">Dr. Samuel Warren</span>, D.C.L.,
F.R.S., &amp;c. &amp;c., when they met
that talented author of <i>The Lily and the Bee</i>, (that <i>sweet,
thoughtful</i> poem, as <span class="smcap">Mrs. Brown</span> calls it,)
 when he promenaded the High
Street in all the scarlet glories of his new D.C.L.-ship? For, if the
Proctors' Black Book be innocent of names branded therein for the dire
offences mentioned, of course there would not be such a Statute for
matriculating members to swear to obey.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">No one shall Loiter about the Streets or the
Public
Market-Place.</span></h4>
</div>

<p>"It is next ordered that nobody should wander idly about the city or
its
suburbs, or be seen loitering about the streets, or the public
market-place; (<i>neque in Plateis, aut publico Foro, stantes aut
commorantes conspiciantur</i>,) just as though Oxford was always in a
state
of insurrection, and it was feared that if groups of students lounged in
the streets, the Riot Act would have to be read, and the military called
out. But, on the whole, I admire this rule also; for I know that when
young men hang about in front of attractive shop-windows, the natural
result is the running up of bills; and my son, <span class="smcap">Peterloo</span>,
 has rather a
pretty taste for jewellery and pictures. I am glad to think, therefore,
that the authorities put a stop to these expensive lounges, and even
punish them '<i>pro arbitrio Vice-Cancellarii, vel Procuratorum</i>.'
But I
cannot help thinking, <i>Mr. Punch</i>, how greatly painters must draw
on
their own imaginations, when they represent the High Street of Oxford as
always enlivened by several of these condemned groups: clearly an
artistic license, as the authorities would have immediately dispersed
them, in accordance with their Statute.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Nobody shall frequent where the Herb Nicotiana
is sold.</span></h4>
</div>

<p>"The next Statute that says nobody must frequent the houses of the
townspeople and the workshops of artificers, without reasonable cause, I
pass over with the simple remark, that it would have been better to have
avoided the gratuitous insult that places respectable houses in the same
clause with others that are both shameless and nameless; and I come to
the next Statute, which says that Nobody shall frequent the taverns,
wine-shops, or places within the city and University precincts, where
wine, or any other liquor, or the herb Nicotiana or 'Tobacco,' is
commonly sold. ('<i>Cauponis, Ænopoliis ac domibus</i> * * * <i>in
quibus
vinum, aut quivis alius potus, aut herba Nicotiana sive</i> Tobacco,
<i>ordinarie venditur, abstineant</i>), and that the townspeople who
admit
the students to such houses shall be heavily fined, or punished with
loss of custom for a certain time.</p>

<p>"Bless me, <i>Mr. Punch</i>! to think that I have smoked tobacco all
my life,
and called it by its wrong name! But, as <span class="smcap">Sam Slick</span>
 observes of the
Frenchman, 'Blow'd if he didn't call a hat a shappo! This comes of his
not speaking English!' so, I suppose, I fell into the mistake of calling
the herb Nicotiana by its vulgar name of Tobacco, from not having had
the advantage of an Oxford education. The Statute speaks for itself. It
entirely sets at rest those absurd reports that we hear and read of the
great consumption in Oxford of wines and spirituous liquors, pale ale,
and the herb Nicotiana; and when my neighbour's son, <span class="smcap">Bellingham
 Grey</span>, of
Christchurch, has the politeness to offer me a 'weed' (he does not call
it a 'herb,' I observe, so I suppose the plant has degenerated,) which
he says he purchased at <span class="smcap">Castle's</span>, or some
other great stronghold for
Oxford smokers; and when he further entertains me with accounts of snug
little undergraduate dinners at the Star, or Mitre, and how from the
effects of an injudicious mixture of liquors the waiter's face came to
be artistically corked and otherwise taken liberties with; and when he
narrates other anecdotes of a like pleasant nature, I must suppose that
he takes me for a Marine, and tells his tales accordingly. For it is
very evident to all sensible persons, that when the authorities require
the students to swear <i>not</i> to do these things, and to receive
certain
punishments if they do them, that they would be strict in enforcing the
Statute, and would not tamely suffer either thoughtless undergraduates
to break their oaths, or the unfortunate tavern and shop-keepers, and
vendors of the herb Nicotiana, to run a risk of fines and loss of
custom. Would they, <i>Mr. Punch</i>? I should rayther think not, says</p>

<h2>THE DOOM OF WESTMINSTER BRIDGE.</h2>

<p>The Act has at length passed for the total destruction of Westminster
Bridge, and another bridge is to succeed, which, if it is really to
succeed, must be as unlike as possible to the existing bridge, which has
been a complete failure. The career of this bridge has been downward
from the first, and its continuance has been a phenomenon similar to
that which is illustrated by the old saying that "a creaking door hangs
long upon the hinges." Westminster Bridge has been, as long as we can
remember, "going, going, going," and it has been a matter of constant
wonder that it had never yet "gone." We have never on traversing it been
able to look back upon it with the respect due to "the bridge that
carries us safely over," for we have always felt that the safety was due
rather to good fortune than to any merit the bridge itself had to rest
upon.</p>

<p>We cannot help feeling delighted that an act of Parliament will at
last
put this unhappy old bridge out of its misery, instead of sanctioning
the further infliction of the painful operations to which it has been
subjected. The poor old bridge is no longer to be maimed and mutilated,
but it is to be made away with once and for ever. It has already
undergone the process of trepanning, by having something removed from
its crown, and it has long ago been able to boast of nothing better than
wooden legs, by the process of giving it timbers to stand upon, as well
as wooden arms, by the substitution of wood-work for its old original
balustrades. We are delighted that the old nuisance will not be suffered
to die in its bed, or rather in the bed of the river, into which it
daily threatened to tumble. Westminster Bridge has, indeed, had a fair
trial, for it has been tried by its piers, and its condemnation has been
the inevitable result, for its piers have been, perhaps, the chief cause
of its downfall.</p>

they are all alike, so there is no use in your making a protest on

your accommodation! And this is the omnipotent Parliament, that has only
to say that coals shall not smoke, and they instantly emit nothing but
perfumed incense; that cabmen shall not cheat, and they at once become
as polite as guardsmen (and a great deal politer); that candidates shall
not bribe, and they immediately begin to pay the voters who have opposed
them, just to prevent the poor men from being unlawfully rewarded by
their own friends. And yet this wonderful Parliament pretends that it
cannot find a ship or two to take its own wives to see the Queen review
the fleet! The men must think you are perfect geese, my dear <span
class="smcap">Loo</span>, to
offer you such rubbishing excuses. It is very well for <span
class="smcap">Augustus</span> that he
married you and not me, as he was once inclined to do (he <i>was</i>, so
 you
need not make a face), for you accept 'the House' as an excuse for
everything, and are afraid to look at the newspaper in the morning to
see what hour Parliament rose, for fear you should discover that he
<i>could</i> not have been waiting for a division at three. And you
believe,
too, that it is necessary for him to be full dressed for a debate, and
that it produces just the same effect upon him as champagne does upon
ordinary men. O, <span class="smcap">Louisa</span>! But you <i>like</i>
it, I believe.</p>

<p>Well, as I have not got an <span class="smcap">Augustus</span> to
tell me stories and leave me at
home, I went with <span class="smcap">Lady de Gules</span> and her
sister to Portsmouth, and every
kind of care was taken of us. We went from the hotel (where I hear they
were demanding unheard-of prices from strangers, and charging them five
guineas for leave to pass the night on a hob, with the run of the fender
for a dressing-room), and some naval officers whom <span class="smcap">Lady
 de Gules</span> ordered
up for our service&#8212;her brother, you know, is a Lord of
Admiralty&#8212;escorted us through the dockyard, and had a boat waiting at
the stairs to take us to a great steamship lying in the harbour. Now, I
should like to know why the wives of Parliament could not have had this
very ship. There was plenty of room, nothing could be nicer. We had an
awning over us, and the Captain ordered one of the cannons to be taken
in, so that we had the porthole for a window, and there we clustered,
<span class="smcap">Lady de Gules</span> having shawls and things put
upon the cannon, and perching
herself on the top. There were a few good people on board, but I rather
think that at the last moment, when the Admiralty authorities found that
they did not want the tickets, they flung them to the local folks, who
came on board very fussy and angular&#8212;horrid men, all in black at ten in
the morning, and women covered with jewellery, which one of the little
middies said they bought cheap of the Jews in the High Street&#8212;it <i>did</i>
look like it. However, they kept at a respectful distance, and sneered
at one another. Some of the officers on board were very attentive, and
if I wanted to marry a man in uniform, I would sooner have the
sea-livery than the land. They are fresher, and much pleasanter to talk
to than the hardened army men, and really think more of you than the
other spoiled creatures do. It was quite delightful to see them fly
about to make you comfortable, doing things the soldier-officers, as
your dreadful child calls them, would faint at the idea of&#8212;except at
Chobham, where I admit they behave very decently. I should think it was
not impossible for a woman to get to like a sailor pretty well, if she
saw nobody else.</p>

<p>About the sight itself, my dear <span class="smcap">Loui</span>, you
had better ask somebody who
understood it&#8212;your husband, perhaps, for he was in the <i>Bulldog</i>,
which
behaved dreadfully ill, breaking the line, or some fearful seawater
crime. First, when the <span class="smcap">Queen</span> came in her
yellow yacht, the guns were
fired, and then there was a long pause, while she visited the <i>Duke of
Wellington</i>, a monster of a ship with, I think they said, eleven
hundred
and thirty-one guns, or tons, or something; but you must not take
figures from me. Then we all went away in a sea-procession, which was
very pretty, the great ships in long lines in the middle, hundreds of
steamboats and thousands of yachts following in a miscellaneous crowd,
the sun shining very brightly, and the sea as green as grass. <span
class="smcap">Lady de
Gules</span>, like a goose, fancied herself sea-sick, which I believe
she would
do if a glass of salt-water were set upon her dressing-table; but we
would not pity her, and she thought better of it. While we were at
lunch&#8212;at which the officers behaved with great devotion, and a
disinterestedness remarkably unlike something you and I have seen&#8212;it
seems that the fleet was cannonading an enemy, but I looked out of
window and could see nothing but smoke, so we stayed where we were.</p>

</div>

<p>I send you a sketch of it from memory. <i>Entre nous</i>, I was not
quite
unprofitably engaged. I do not know whether it will come to anything,
but just ask <span class="smcap">Augustus</span>, <i>from yourself</i>,
whether the Shropshire branch of
the <span class="smcap">Lartonbury</span> family is the right one, and
if he knows <span class="smcap">Henry
Lartonbury</span>. Swanby House, or Hall, or something, is, I think, the
 family
place, but I have some idea that <i>my</i> <span class="smcap">Lartonburys</span>
 don't live there.
Until I know this, of course, I can say nothing, but it is a <i>strong
case</i>, and he can wait with great safety. Be sure you ask <span
class="smcap">Augustus</span>, and
write to me directly to <span class="smcap">Lady de Gules's</span>.</p>

<p>"We came to town by a special train with lots of Members of
Parliament.
I could not see <span class="smcap">Augustus</span>, my dear, but the

looked on leaving you. O you silly <span class="smcap">Louisa</span>!</p>

<h4>IMPORTANT MEETING OF SMOKE MAKERS.</h4>
</div>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Immense excitement prevails among an important class of
manufacturers&#8212;those engaged in the manufacture of that atmospheric
canopy, the sable expanse of which extends over London and its environs,
serving the inhabitants of the whole metropolitan district as a parasol.
The cause of this commotion is the Smoke Nuisance Bill&#8212;so called;
against which a number of gentlemen, and others, professing the
principles of Free Carbon, met last night to protest, at the
Hole-and-Corner.</p>

<p>The chair having been taken by <span class="smcap">Mr. Sutkins</span>, the business of the meeting
commenced with uproar. Comparative silence having been obtained, <span class="smcap">Mr.
Longshaft</span>, brewer, rose to move a resolution, that the principle of the
Smoke Bill was at variance with the constitution of England. At a time
when London was much more smoky than it is now, it was said that
"Liberty is like the air we breathe." Could any atmosphere be more
salubrious than that air? Smoke possessed curative properties,
especially in reference to hams; and the very essence of smoke was
applied for the cure of kippered salmon. He had sent some bottles of
smoke from his own brew-house to a celebrated German chemist, who had
written him a certificate in the form of a letter, to the effect that he
had analysed the smoke, and found it to consist principally of carbon,
which possessed antiseptic properties; sulphurous and carbonic acid
gases: the former of which acted as a tonic, whilst the latter
constituted the enlivening element of bottled ale and stout, ginger beer
and soda water. The philosopher had accompanied this statement by a
declaration that he, for his part, liked the smoke as a perfume, and
would be glad to be supplied with a few more bottles of it for his
personal use. Hitherto this beautiful smoke had been allowed to waste
its sweetness on the London air, which was now threatened with the
deprivation of that singular advantage. The loss of the smoke would not
affect him individually much, as he lived some distance out of town; and
could only indulge in a whiff now and then, when he went to his place of
business. He regarded the attack upon their chimneys as the commencement
of an invasion of their hearths; and exhorted all who meant to defend
the latter to rally round the former. (<i>Great applause.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Funnell</span>, Captain of a Thames steamer,
seconded the resolution. In
his situation he had good opportunities of hearing the expression of
public opinion about the Smoke Bill. People said if Parliament objected
to volumes of smoke, why did they publish so many Blue Books? If they
wanted to prevent chimneys from puffing they shouldn't have took off the
Advertisement duty. What was the use of emancipating Blacks abroad if
they wasn't to enjoy freedom at home? That was what the Public had to
say about the matter. For his part he looked on the separation of fire
and smoke as a unnatural divorce. Consume his own smoke! Why they might
as well ask him to consume his own wife. Fire without smoke&#8212;by-and-bye,
he supposed, it would be bread without butter. What? he expected the
next thing would be your scientific legislators would bring in a bill
for dividing thunder and lightning. He called this here Smoke Bill the
Repeal of the Union. A little smoke on the river was wholesome. A stream
that had such a lot of sewers flowing into it required fumigation. He
had heard passengers returning from Kew Gardens talk about plants there
that lived upon air. In course, the more substance there was in the air
the more nutritions it must be both for wegetable and hanimal life.
Legislation was going too fast. Ease her! stop her! take a turn astarn!
As to this tyrannical and arbitrary Bill of <span class="smcap">Lord
Palminster's</span> for the
consumption of smoke, he should give it every opposition: and he hoped
through their united efforts it would be brought to end in that wery
identical object it was directed agin. (<i>Much cheering.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Cowl</span> had the honour to belong to a
branch of the medical profession.
His practice was the cure of smoky chimneys. He protested against a
measure which would deprive him of his patients; and if the Smoke Act
was enforced he hoped at least he should receive compensation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Gentlet</span> was a producer of smoke. He
supposed his interests were
affected by this measure, which required the producer to be also the
consumer, but did they call that political economy? To be sure he was
not the proprietor of a chimney; but he possessed a nose: which came to
the same thing. The very occupation he pursued was that of smoking. It
was the employment of his life. It might not be a very useful branch of
industry: but it was an ornamental one. They knew by the smoke that so
gracefully curled from the end of his weed that a Pickwick was near.
They knew that a gent of fashionable exterior and elegant manners was
nigh likewise. If he was obliged to consume his own smoke, how could he
continue to diffuse fragrance in society? He identified himself with the
party of smokers; as he was a smoking party himself. If smoke was such a
nuisance, why did they make so much the other day at the review at
Spithead? Let them put that question in their pipe&#8212;and, he would add,
smoke it. Talking of pipes, he would tell <span class="smcap">Palmerston</span>
 that his idea of a
chimney consuming its own smoke was a mere sham.</p>

<p>[<i>The speaker resumed his seat amid great laughter, principally
from
himself, and the meeting terminated as it began, with clamour.</i></p>

<p class="cap_3">WHY should young ladies in distress commit suicide, or
turn governesses
in genteel families, when they might earn a decent competence by
penny-a-lining? Can they? Why yes, to be sure they can. For example,
here is a piece of that work as characteristic as crochet:&#8212;</p>
</div>
<blockquote><p>"<span class="smcap">The Moors.</span>&#8212;This morning, with
 the break of dawn, the quick report
of the rifle would be heard on all the moors of Scotland, and before
this sheet is in the hands of our readers, many thousand boxes of
birds will have been bagged by the keen sportsmen."</p></blockquote>

<p>"Many thousand boxes of birds," each box containing several, will
have
been "bagged by the keen sportsmen;" every single bird almost out of the
several thousand bagged on "the quick report of the rifle." For, you
see, the rifle could not, except very rarely, kill two birds with one
bullet: so that a brace of grouse dropping to the "quick report of the
rifle" would be a rare occurrence. Pop goes the rifle; down goes the
bird, perhaps; but that is all, in general. As the keenest sportsmen,
however, sometimes miss, and rifle balls have a longish range, the
sporting on these moors must have been rather dangerous to unfeathered
birds as well as to game. Six shots might "achieve;" but the seventh, at
least, would, in all probability, "deceive," as the British
melodramatist says in <i>Der Freischütz</i>. But we are ourselves firing
 wide
of our mark, or digressing from the point: which is, that the above
paragraph, copied from the <i>Stirling Journal</i>, is evidently the
production of a lady. The sex of the writer is betrayed in the vague
allusion to "the rifle." A masculine scribe, with that precision in
reference to shooting that cannot be expected from the female mind, would
have been more specific, and would have told us whether these wonderful
Scotch rifles that brought down so many grouse were <i>Minié</i> rifles
or
American revolvers.</p>

<p>The manuscript of the following "True Discovery of Iximaya," by "a wit
of this court" (as the old Spanish dramatists would have said), was
brought to <i>Mr. Punch's</i> office, together with three pounds of chocolate
and a box of cigars, by an unknown hand. <i>Mr. Punch</i> forgives the mixed
jargon of the verses, being moved thereto by the integrity of the
chocolate and cigars, which were entirely Spanish; but, as his readers
have not tasted of the one, or inhaled the fumes of the other, he has
employed three of the best Spanish scholars in the Foreign Office

<h2>SABBATARIAN TEMPERANCE MEETING AT GLASGOW.</h2>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/080.png" alt="A" class="cap" width="30%" />

<p class="cap_3">A Numerous and highly influenced meeting took place
last evening at
Glasgow, to protest against the proposed opening of the Crystal Palace
on Sundays, as being likely to lead to that of other instructive
exhibitions, tending to seduce the people from the spirituous observance
of the Sabbath.</p>
</div>

<p>It is notorious that the sobriety of Scotland, generally, is
particularly exemplified in the statistics of drunkenness at Glasgow.
The assembly of Sabbatarians was held in the building appropriately
denominated the National Temperance Hall. There were about a thousand
persons present, though a gentleman on the platform declared that he saw
twice as many.</p>

<p>The chair having been taken by a <span class="smcap">Mr. M'Glashan</span>,
 or <span class="smcap">Gregalach</span>&#8212;we could
not, as he himself gave the name, make out which&#8212;the proceedings
commenced with an inarticulate solemnity. The Chairman then called upon
<span class="smcap">Miss Smasher</span>&#8212;as we understood. He meant,
however, <span class="smcap">Mr. Maxswill</span>, deacon
and drysalter, who said&#8212;Gemman-ladies&#8212;hech!&#8212;that is,

<p>The speaker then proceeded to move a resolution, but found
unfortunately
that he could not see to read it. He was followed in speeches of a
character similar to the above, by <span class="smcap">Baillie M'Bree</span>,
 <span class="smcap">Mr. Sottie M'Quaigh</span>,
<span class="smcap">Mr. Pintstoupie</span>, <span class="smcap">Mr.

 "<i>We

 in
a state of excitement bordering on <i>delirium tremens</i>.</p>

<h2>THE BOUNCE OF A PISTOL.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J. V. Shelley</span> reads a circular in the
House of Commons summoning
certain members to attend on a certain occasion for a certain party
purpose. The document bears the signature of <span class="smcap">C. H.
Frewen</span>. It is couched
in a spirit of low cunning, and tends to reflect great discredit on its
author.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C. H. Frewen</span> writes to <span
class="smcap">Sir J. V. Shelley</span>, demanding to know from
whom he had received this circular; a private letter presumably given to
him in breach of confidence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J. V. Shelley</span> replies that the
circular was a printed document, and
therefore not entitled to be considered private. Whereupon <span
class="smcap">Mr. C. H.
Frewen</span> (who dates his letters from Cold Overton Hall) replies
that, no
matter for that, or in whatever way he got possessed of it, the man who
would read such a letter in such a way</p>

<blockquote><p>"Can have no pretensions to call himself a gentleman."</p></blockquote>

<p>But stay. We do not say that all this is true. We only say that it
has
appeared in the <i>Times</i>. For aught we know, the <i>Times</i> may be
 a
facetious contemporary, cracking jokes on the head of <span
class="smcap">Mr. Frewen</span>, as if
it were a thick one. We do not mean to say that <span class="smcap">Mr.
Frewen</span> made such an
ass of himself, as he did make, if his correspondence, as printed in the
<i>Times</i>, is genuine. But, however, <span class="smcap">Sir J. V.
Shelley</span>&#8212;always according
to the <i>Times</i>, mind&#8212;rejoins by desiring of <span class="smcap">Mr.
 Frewen</span> that the whole
of the correspondence should be published, as the first letter had been,
and declining to answer any more letters. And then:&#8212;</p>

<blockquote><p>"<span class="smcap">Mr. Frewen</span> returns this
letter unopened. <span class="smcap">Sir J. Shelly</span> ought to be
aware that <span class="smcap">Mr. Frewen</span> cannot receive any more
 communications from
him except through another person."</p></blockquote>

<p>What does <span class="smcap">Mr. Frewen</span> mean by this?&#8212;if the
nonsense is his really?
Surely not the old bluster, the obsolete bullying trick; Chalk Farm,
pistols and coffee for two, with cock pheasant also if required for the
satisfaction of a gentleman desiring a bellyfull for breakfast. Not an
invitation to fight a duel; that ridiculous anachronism; the necessary
consequence of which in these days, to the principal fools concerned in
it, each of them, must be getting either shot, or imprisoned, or laughed
at; most probably the latter. Shot by the other fool; imprisoned&#8212;if not
hanged&#8212;for shooting him; or laughed at for neither having shot him nor
been shot by him; but probably having simply exchanged with him a blank
pop! If <span class="smcap">Mr. Frewen</span> has indeed been such a
booby as it appears in the
<i>Times</i> that he has, <i>Mr. Punch</i> can only say that he would
recommend
him to change the designation of Cold Overton to that of Clod Hall, and
to assume the name, together with the arms, of <i>Bob Acres</i>.</p>

<h2>HOM&#338;OPATHY SUPERSEDED.</h2>

<center>Here is a gross libel or a fine satire:&#8212;</center>

<h4>EXTRAORDINARY ANTI-SURGICAL OPERATION. THE USE OF THE KNIFE
UNNECESSARY.</h4>

<blockquote><p>MR. R. L&#8212;&#8212;, MEDICAL HERBALIST, 15, <span class="smcap">I&#8212;&#8212;
 Street, Roxburgh Terrace</span>,
begs respectfully to intimate, that as a great many Persons have
been very desirous to see the Serpent which he extracted alive
lately from the breast of a lady labouring under Cancer, he will be
most happy to show it to those interested, any day from 10 to 12
o'clock, at his house, 15, I&#8212;&#8212; Street.<br /><br />

<i>Edinburgh, 12th August, 1853.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>This is either a libel upon somebody or other, glanced at under the
figure of the Serpent: or it is a satire on the gullibility of the
inhabitants of Edinburgh, from the <i>News</i> of which city it is
extracted.
The modern Athenians, with all their acuteness, are said to be rather
susceptible subjects for quackery.</p>

<h2>IMAGINARY PLAY-BILL.</h2>

<p>We observe that at one of the Metropolitan theatres an endeavour has
been made to dramatise <i>The Times</i>. We admit some curiosity to know
 in
what way the leading journal has been adapted to the purposes of the
Stage. During this hot weather it is of course impossible for us to
visit the theatre; but in the mean time we have drawn upon our
melodramatic reminiscences, and have sketched what we suppose must be
the playbill of <i>The Times</i>. We are, however, open to conviction,
should
our anticipations have been inadequate.</p>

<center>ACT ONE.</center>

<p><span class="smcap">Scene 1.</span>&#8212;Printing House Square, by
moonlight. A policeman on duty.
Clank of the steampress heard amid the silence, and distant plash of the
river. Coronetted carriage driven hastily in. Beautiful and fashionable
lady, in opera costume, alights. Her agitation. "<i>He must be saved.</i>"
She dashes hastily into the building. Policeman saunters up and examines
arms on carriage, and the next moment is recognised by the flunkey.
"<i>Ha! my Lord.</i>" "<i>Silence, my faithful</i> <span class="smcap">Jeemes</span>."
 Resumes his walk.
Lights seen along a passage&#8212;mysterious lady is being conducted to the
<span class="smcap">Editorial Chamber</span>!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scene 2.</span>&#8212;The Strand. Meeting of two
Reporters, one coming up from the
House of Commons, the other going down. "<i>Likely to sit?</i>" "<i>Another
hour&#8212;Irish
 row.</i>" "<i>Bless those Irish!</i>" "<i>Amen.</i>" They part&#8212;<i>exit</i>
Reporter to the House. The other lights a cigar, and three ruffians
spring out upon him. They have long Macintosh coats, but beneath the
disguise is seen the glittering uniform of the Guards. "<i>You bring the
wepawt of</i> <span class="smcap">Lord Namby Macpamby's</span> <i>Speech</i>!"
 "<i>I have.</i>" "<i>Hand it
over.</i>" "<i>With my life only.</i>" They seize him, but he dashes his
 cigar
into the face of the first, and wrestles with the second, but would be
over-mastered by the third, when the latter is dashed to the earth. Two
run away, the last is prisoner. "<i>But, who is my preserver?</i>" "<i>Sir,
 I
am but a numble actor, but you were once kyind to me in a notice of my</i>
Clown <i>in the Pantermine, and, believe me, Sir, kyindness is like the
gentle jew from eaven, which droppeth, &amp;c.</i>" They drag the
prisoner
beneath a lamp. "<span class="smcap">The Right Honourable the Marquis of
 Haughtycastle!</span> <i>Ha,
minion!</i>" "<i>Nay, let him go&#8212;my numble Friend. I know the game.</i> <span
 class="smcap">A
Lady's Secret.</span>"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scene 3.</span>&#8212;Same as first. Beautiful woman
comes out in tears. "<i>He was
most courteous, but firm as the monumental adamant.</i>" She enters the
carriage, and throws herself sobbing on the cushion. Policeman springs
in after her, and seating himself opposite, throws his bull's-eye full
on her face. "<i>My husband!</i>" "<i>Aye, wrrrretched woman. Drive on</i>,
<span class="smcap">Jeemes</span>." (In a voice of thunder.) "HOME!"
(With intense irony,) "<i>Your</i>
home, Madam; yours, <i>once loved</i> <span class="smcap">Coronettina</span>."</p>

<center>ACT TWO.</center>

<p>The House of Commons. Very full. Cries of "<i>Order, order!</i>"
Clamour
increases, and no one can be heard. Fifty Members on their legs, trying
to speak. <span class="smcap">Lord John Russell</span> springs upon the
table and gesticulates
violently; but all that can be heard from him, is "<i>Obleege</i>," and
"<i>Constitution</i>." <span class="smcap">Mr. Disraeli</span> dashes
his hand furiously upon the Green
Box, which gives way, and all his oranges roll out. Scramble and comic
business. <span class="smcap">Lord Namby Macpamby</span> rises; dressed
in the extreme of fashion,
and also extremely tipsy. Terrific cries of "<i>Spoke, spoke!</i>" The
Chairman of Committees falls on his knees and pleads for silence, but
sinks beneath the volley of blue books, votes, and bills, instantly
hurled at him from all the Members. Suddenly the <span class="smcap">Speaker</span>
 rushes in,
seizes the mace, and lays about him on every side. Members are knocked
over one another. Tremendous confusion! Fights!&#8212;and Curtain.</p>

<center>ACT THREE.</center>

<p>The Editor's Ante-Chamber. Several of the Ministers waiting to see
him;
some with glittering stars, blue ribbons, &amp;c. A door opens (centre),
 and
an eminent Stockjobber is kicked into the middle of the scene, and
falls&#8212;a huge bag of sovereigns in each hand. Bags burst, and the gold
strews the stage. "<i>I offered £500,000 for leave to put in one
article.</i>" Proud tribute to the British Press. Porters sweep up the
gold, and throw it out at window, and the Stockjobber after it. Enter
<span class="smcap">Lord Asterisk</span> dragging the beautiful lady. "<i>Ha!
 you here, my lords! But
'tis well. She appealed to the "Times" and I have brought her hither.</i>"
Lady
 on her knees&#8212;back hair down. "<i>I am innocent&#8212;indeed I am
innocent.</i>" "<i>I am not to be juped, Madam.</i>" "<i>I swear it.</i>"
 "<i>I believe
you not. Your adorers, in disguise, have been staining the pure streets
of our proud Metropolis with ruffianism. But in vain, Madam.</i>" "<i>In
vain! Wretched me!</i>" "<i>Now by all that is sulphureous</i>"&#8212;(he
draws the
sword usually worn by the British aristocrat)&#8212;"HOLD!!!" Awful
appearance of the <span class="smcap">Editor</span>. "<i>Mistaken
nobleman! She came but to save her</i>
<span class="smcap">Brother, Lord Namby Macpamby</span>. <i>He has
spoken in the House to-night, and

 "<i>Ow!
ow! ow! Can you forgive me</i>, <span class="smcap">Coronettina</span>?"
 "<i>Am I not your wife,
dearest?</i>" The <span class="smcap">Editor</span>, moved, tears up <span

"<i>One husk will not be missed amid so much chaff.</i>"</p>

<h2>BREAKING-UP DAY AT WESTMINSTER.</h2>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/085.png" alt="T" class="cap" width="17%" />

<p class="cap_3">THE Director-General of the St. Stephen's establishment, <i>Mr. Punch</i>,
proceeded, in one cab, to Westminster Hall, and, desiring a chair to be
placed for him upon the top of the flight of steps at the further end,
commanded that the gentlemen of the Upper and Lower Schools should
forthwith attend him, for the purpose of hearing his opinion of their
general and individual conduct, preparatory to their being dismissed for
the holidays. It is needless to say that his orders were instantly
complied with, and that the Westminster Boys at once assembled before
him. The only exception was in the case of <span class="smcap">Master Sibthorp</span>, who sturdily
refused to come, and for whom a policeman was dispatched. <span class="smcap">Master
Sibthorp</span> expended much abuse, and several quotations from the Eton
Grammar, upon the officer, but was ultimately brought in, and placed
within convenient reach of <i>Mr. Punch's</i> cane. <i>Mr. Punch</i> then spoke as

I will refer you to the head of the gallant member for Lincoln, or to
the heads of those who can be such donkeys as to elect him. My boys, I
am, generally speaking, satisfied with your conduct during the half.</p>

<p class="salute">"<span class="smcap">Boys of the Upper School</span>,</p>

<p>"I rejoice to find a marked improvement in the way you treat your
themes. Your elocution is still open to amendment. I commend your
regular adherence to the beneficial habit of early rising. I would
caution you against quarrels amongst yourselves, arising from the use of
intemperate speech or inapt quotation (<i>Masters</i> <span class="smcap">Derby</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Oxford</span>
<i>blushed</i>); and I would remind you that no social position occupied by
your papas and mammas exempts any of you from the duties which are
imposed upon others (<i>Master</i> <span class="smcap">Winchelsea</span> <i>began to cry</i>). But, as a
whole, you have pleased me this year, and I will add that the politeness
with which you behave to ladies who may look in upon the establishment
reflects great credit upon you, not unincreased by contrast (<i>Sensation
among the Lower School</i>).</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Aberdeen</span>, you are leader of the school,
and I could wish you to display
more energy. I applaud your love for a peaceful life, but remember that
there is one thing better than peace, and that is, honour. In the map of
Russia, which you have drawn, you have not defined the boundaries
strongly and well, and you do not seem to know where Turkey begins and
Russia ends. You will lose credit unless you exert yourself.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Malmesbury</span>, your English is exceedingly
bad, and your logic very
unsatisfactory. I understand that you are proud of your intimacy with a
French person, who at one time bore no good character. Take care, sir.
And be more guarded in your assertions as to what feats you have
accomplished, and of which I find few traces in the school records.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Lansdowne</span>, I give you much credit for
having just exerted yourself to
put down the practice of smoking&#8212;the rather, as you have reached an age
at which you are entitled to all due indulgence. You are a very
excellent member of the school, and I wish you regarded as a model.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Monteagle</span>, you talk a great deal too much
 in school hours, and are said
to busy yourself in matters with which you have no concern. You have
been a lucky boy&#8212;be an agreeable one.</p>

<p class="salute">"<span class="smcap">Boys of the Lower School</span>,</p>

<p>"I am sorry to have had to expel so many of your number this half,
but I
hope it will be a warning. Once for all, I will not permit you, by gifts
of money or beer, to induce your inferiors to misconduct themselves for
your gratification. I can use no adequate word of contempt for the
meanness which sought to shift the guilt upon servants. In other
respects I am tolerably satisfied with most of you. A good deal of work
has been done, but there is far too much talking in the establishment,
and you keep people out of their beds looking after you at hours when
you ought to be asleep. I hope to have different reports next half.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Russell</span>, I am glad to see you the leader
of the school. I was pleased
with your conduct to the Jew boys, whom I still intend to place in the
school. I am sorry you have done next to nothing in the way of helping
the education of those under you. However, as you have given me a large
promise of reform for next half, I shall say no more.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Gladstone</span>, you deserve the highest praise
 for your proficiency in
arithmetic, and for your gentlemanly conduct. Some of your companions
hint that you talk rather too much. I do not impute this to you, but you
will consider for yourself whether the allegation is justified. The way
you have got through all duties is admirable.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Cardwell</span>, I shall give you a
well-deserved navigation prize, so you
need not be quite so solemn.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Stafford</span>, the painful exposure I was
compelled to make of your conduct
would have prevented my referring to it again, but that I understand you
and some of your friends have been swaggering, and declaring that you
had escaped unpunished. Beware, Sir, that I never again hear your voice
in the school, in which I only permit you to remain because I believe
that you were made the tool of bigger and worse boys.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Fitzroy</span>, I am sorry to see that you are
not looking well. Take care of
yourself in the country, and be assured, my boy, that I shall not forget
the spirited way in which you protected those poor women from their
husbands' brutality, or the very proper chastisement you gave to the
insolent cabman.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Lucas</span>, you are a foolish lad. Instead of
enjoying the rational and
manly liberty of your companions, you cripple your mind with silly
stories and legends, and do not take your meals regularly. I hear, too,
that you are very ignorant of the history of Rome, which you appear to
have learned at second-hand from some monkish book in dog-Latin. You are
no credit to your class, Sir, and I believe I have told you before that
you are Lucas, <i>à non lucendo</i>.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Brotherton</span>, I applaud you for trying to
get the school to bed by
midnight, but you want perseverance, and let yourself be put down by any
one who opposes you. If you are right and know it, never give way. Be
firm, or you will not carry your objects&#8212;you cannot bolt a door with a
boiled carrot, as you, as a vegetarian, ought to know.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Palmerston</span>, you are a very spirited,
gentlemanly, thoroughly English
fellow, in whom I have the utmost confidence. All that you have done
this half has been excellent. I believe it would give everybody pleasure
to see you at the head of the school, and it rests with yourself whether
you will be so or not. <i>Excelsior</i>, my good boy. By the way, I have
 of
course nothing to do with your amusements, but I observed you gave
<span class="smcap">Master Corden</span> a tremendous back fall the
other day. It has shaken him a
good deal, but he richly deserved it for the sneaking way he came to the
scratch.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sibthorp</span>, as you say that you consider it an honour for me to notice
you, why do you not so conduct yourself that what is certainly an honour
to you may be a pleasure to me? (<span class="smcap">Sibthorp</span> <i>burst into tears</i>.) There,
don't cry, you know I am never seriously angry with <i>you</i>.</p>

<h4>The Land Screw Steam Company.</h4>

<p>We believe the General Screw Steam Shipping Company is connected with
the Port of Southampton. It may not be generally known that there exists
another Screw Steam concern in connexion with that same good town. We
mean the South-Western Railway, which, particularly by its arrangements
respecting the Camp at Chobham, and the Review at Spithead, appears to
have decidedly adopted the principle of the Screw.</p>

<h4>FIGHTING FREWEN AND SOBER SHELLEY.</h4>

<p>There appeared a chance a few days ago, that certain Members of
Parliament would, instead of shooting the grouse, have the more exciting
sport of shooting one another. <span class="smcap">Sir John Shelley</span>
 very properly refuses to
be drawn into either a murder or a breach of the peace; and quietly
refers <span class="smcap">Mr. Frewen's</span> furious correspondence to
 <span class="smcap">Messrs. Tyrrell</span>, <span class="smcap">Paine</span>,
and <span class="smcap">Layton</span>, who are, we presume, <span
class="smcap">Sir John's</span> solicitors.</p>

<p>A "little quarrel" with a legal firm may be less agreeable to one whom
 we
fear we must call Fighting <span class="smcap">Frewen</span>, than a
personal <i>rencontre</i> with the
Member for Westminster. A fight with a forensic antagonist in
Westminster Hall is more formidable than a little harmless
pistol-popping at Chalk Farm; and the powder of a barrister's wig is
more dangerous to be set in agitation than the common gunpowder of
commerce.</p>

<p>Poor <span class="smcap">Frewen</span> is evidently much nettled at
finding that <span class="smcap">Sir John Shelley</span>
won't fight, and in the desperate endeavour to stir up the unwilling
baronet, tries the old cab-driver's dodge of calling after him "No
gentleman!" We must say we cannot congratulate <span class="smcap">Mr.
Frewen</span> upon having
got the best of the matter in either spirit, taste, or argument; for
there is something more dignified in <span class="smcap">Sir John
Shelley's</span> request to be
"excused from answering any further letters," than in <span
class="smcap">Mr. Frewen's</span>
coarse wind up of "Call yourself a gentleman!"</p>

<h4>A NEW LACTOMETER.</h4>

<p>A great philanthropist, and distinguished man of the world, has
invented
a new Lactometer for testing the milk of human kindness. We believe it
is exceedingly simple, and consists principally of a plain sheet of
paper&#8212;not unlike, in size, a page torn out of a banker's cheque-book,
but having a Government Stamp in the corner of it. It is the size of
this stamp that determines the quantity of milk of human kindness. The
larger the stamp the greater the supply of milk. The test rarely fails,
excepting with lawyers, guardians, step-fathers, and others, whose hardy
natures are well known not to be largely imbued with the softening
lacteal properties of human kindness. The philanthropist intends taking
out a patent for his ingenious invention.</p>

<h2>FUMIGATION OF THE THAMES.</h2>

<p>Tobacco fumes are unpleasant to the majority of ladies. Nevertheless,
 we
must protest against the prohibition of smoking abaft the funnel on
board Thames steamers. The other day we were ascending the river in one
of these vessels, seated in that quarter of it, when a youth, who was
indulging in a Pickwick to the windward of us, was caused to transfer
himself and his enjoyment forwards. No sooner had he gone away with his
smoke, than our nostrils were assailed by the vilest of odours; a breath
from the open mouth of a sewer on the opposite bank. This was just as we
were passing the <span class="smcap">Archbishop's</span> Palace at
Lambeth; and we could almost
have imagined that <span class="smcap">Dr. Sumner</span> had been at
work purifying the Church, and
had rendered its abuses palpable to the olfactory sense; in such great
indignation were our nostrils at the perfume emitted in the
neighbourhood of his Grace's premises. We wished our young friend back
again with his "weed," the fragrance of which we very much prefer to
that of metropolitan tributaries to the Thames: and until that stream is
somewhat dulcified, we should think that even ladies would approve of
universal fumigation on board its boats.</p>

<hr />

<h4>The Enemy.</h4>

<p>The question of Peace has been carried in Europe, <i>nem. con.</i>
<span class="smcap">Bright</span>,
feeling peacefully inclined, said he should like all war-questions to be
met and decided by a similar enemy; and, being asked by <span
class="smcap">Cobden</span> "What
enemy?"&#8212;he eloquently replied, "A-<i>n-emine contradicente</i>."</p>

<hr />

<h4>WHAT YOU MAY HEAR IN A BELL.</h4>

<p>A curious old philosopher of our acquaintance says:&#8212;"I can always
tell
what kind of masters and servants there are in an establishment by the
way in which the bell is rung and answered. If the bell is rung sharply,
or snappishly, or at all loudly, I say to myself, You are hard masters,
impatient, intolerant, making no allowances, and always expecting a
thing to be done before it is even asked for, and my suspicions are
generally verified by their ringing the bell a second time more loudly
than the first; and if the servants take a long time in answering the
bell, I say to myself, You are bad servants, either lazy or pampered, or
spoilt by too much indulgence, and evidently taking but little interest
in your master's wishes. It is a sure sign that there is not much peace
or comfort to be met with in the house where the master rings several
times for everything he wants; and where the servants require the bell
to be rung twice before they think of answering it."</p>

<h2>A Naval Blunderbuss.</h2>

<p>We are sorry to notice an anachronism in a popular review. We mean
the
review at Spithead. A gun was used in the fleet, called&#8212;we cannot say
christened&#8212;the "<span class="smcap">Nelson Avenger</span>." Now <span
class="smcap">Nelson</span> has been sufficiently
avenged; if insufficiently honoured: whatever account of vengeance may
have been owing to him was settled at the time; though our debt of
gratitude to him may be eternal. Posterity has no revenge to take on
Posterity: and a gun only meant to rake the rigging of our enemies
should not be so named as to rake up animosities with our friends.</p>

<h2>THE INQUISITION AT MALTA.</h2>

<p>Here is a pretty dish that was to have been set before the <span
class="smcap">Queen</span>:&#8212;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Whosoever, during the performance of the sacred
functions or
ceremonies of the Church of the country, the Roman Catholic
Apostolic Church, the maintenance and protection of which, in its
present position, are secured by law, and guaranteed by the British
Crown, shall disturb the same with violence or with intent to
profane, whether within or without places appointed for public
worship, shall be punished with imprisonment, from seven months to
two years."</p></blockquote>

<p>According to <span class="smcap">Mr. I. Butt</span> this passage is
contained in the 50th Clause of
the amended Maltese Criminal Code which has been coolly sent to this
country for the sanction of <span class="smcap">Her Majesty</span>.</p>

<p>No doubt a person who should wantonly interrupt a congregation of
Mormonites, or even of dancing Dervishes, engaged in their devotions,
would deserve to be punished; of course, therefore, there is no
complaining of a law which avenges interference with Roman Catholic
rites and ceremonies&#8212;those rites and ceremonies not going quite so far
as the rite of cremation and the ceremony of an <i>auto-da-fé</i>.</p>

<p>It is also indubitable that the adherents of the Romish Church have a
perfect right to call their persuasion Catholic and Apostolic, or
anything else they please, and hold that assertion against all comers,
by all means: except, we will say, by means of fire and sword.</p>

<p>But to propose the recognition of the Roman Catholic Church, as
Apostolical, to the <span class="smcap">Queen of England</span>,
is&#8212;without reference to
polemics&#8212;richly absurd: since <span class="smcap">Her Majesty</span>
holds her royal seat on the
very condition of constantly protesting&#8212;right or wrong&#8212;that the Roman
Catholic Church is no such thing.</p>

<p>If <i>Mr. Punch</i> were in Malta, writing under this same amended
criminal
code, he would have to take care how he pointed out any Roman Catholic
absurdity. He is informed by <span class="smcap">Mr. Newdegate</span>,</p>

<blockquote><p>"That the 54th Clause declared it to be punishable to
'revile or
otherwise insult or ridicule any article of the Roman Catholic
Church.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>Now there are other varieties of ridicule than burlesque, caricature,
horse-laughter, and making faces. There is the ridicule of the <i>reductio
ad
 absurdum</i>. It is possible to place a proposition in a ludicrous
light
by showing that if it is true, it is a truth which is contrary to
another truth. In Malta, therefore, subject to the above clause, it
would be dangerous to assert the impenetrability of matter, or any other
fact in the nature of things inconsistent with any dogma of the papal
system: and if <i>Mr. Punch</i> were not to mind what he was about, he
might
get himself into trouble in like manner with that other buffoon,
<span class="smcap">Galileo</span>.</p>

<p>However, <span class="smcap">Mr. Kinnaird</span> has procured the
re-consideration of these penal
papisticalities: and Ministers will think twice before they advise <span
 class="smcap">Her
Majesty</span> to stultify herself and sanction a Maltese Inquisition.</p>

<h2>A HINT TO BELGRAVIA, TYBURNIA, CADOGANIA, &amp;c. &amp;c.</h2>

<p>We hint to noblemen and gentlemen of (very) independent property,
before
rushing out of town, that they should think of the numerous little bills
they leave behind them. They would not enjoy themselves any the less if
they discharged those little bills instead of making their tradesmen
wait six long empty-pocketed mouths for them. The probability is, even,
they would enjoy themselves all the more, knowing that they had left a
clear coast behind them, where they could always land with safety
whenever they wanted to escape from foreign pirates, and continental
sharks, sea and land robbers. We beg, (merely moved by a charitable
motive to add to their pleasures,) to draw up the following
advertisement for them, on the plan of the one issued at the end of the
season by the Directors of the Covent Garden Italian Opera:&#8212;</p>

<blockquote><p>ALL persons having claims for the last season upon the <span
 class="smcap">Right
Honourable Lord Tom Noddy</span> are requested, before he leaves for
Baden-Baden, Homburg, Wiesbaden, &amp;c., where he is going to take the
usual annual course of <i>rouge et-noir</i> and the mineral waters, to
send in their accounts immediately, and to apply on Saturday, the
27th inst., when they will be paid in full, as the <span class="smcap">Right
 Honourable
Lord Tom Noddy</span> has no desire to increase the ducal revenues of

<img src="images/089.png" alt="T" class="cap" width="25%" />

<p class="cap_3">THE <i>Wolverhampton Chronicle</i> contains the
following paragraph, highly
important to ladies:&#8212;</p>
</div>

<blockquote><p>"<span class="smcap">The Woman's Walk.</span>&#8212;<span
class="smcap">Mrs. Dunn's</span> pedestrian feat&#8212;walking 1,000 miles
in 1,000 hours&#8212;at Noah's Ark, Hartshill, continues to attract much
attention, great numbers of people visiting her. She has
accomplished about four-sixths of the task, and is very confident of
success."</p></blockquote>

<p>It has been said with no less truth than vulgarity, that the walking
of
womankind is all <span class="smcap">Walker</span>. Too generally,
indeed, it resembles a mode of
progression adopted by the insect tribes, except in being performed with
two legs instead of several, or without any at all. All praise to the
exception to this rule presented by <span class="smcap">Mrs. Dunn</span>.
 We have not the pleasure
of being acquainted with either that lady or <span class="smcap">Mr.
Dunn</span>, but sure we are
that she makes her husband a happy man if the health of his wife can
make a man happy; as of course it can or should: whereas her illness at
least makes him very much the reverse. By exercise in the open air is
acquired that soundness of condition, accompanied by mental serenity and
beauty of complexion which can never result from dancing in an
atmosphere of carbonic acid&#8212;the only purpose for which many, many
ladies use their legs. What <span class="smcap">Mr. Dunn's</span>
partner costs him for shoes, we
are sure he does not grudge, and he would be a fool if he did, for it is
much cheaper that she should walk him out a little leather than that she
should stand him in a large quantity of medicine: to say nothing of the
cabs and omnibuses which are frequently required to travel a hundred
yards or so by other wives.</p>

<h2>BRITISH OBSEQUIES IN SPAIN</h2>

<p>If you wish to save your Succession Duty, reform your Undertaker's
Bills. There is nothing to prevent you but the censure of the lowest
vulgar&#8212;the mob that does not think for itself: a mob composed of quite
as many well dressed persons as ragamuffins. Unfortunately, however,
this populace may be able to injure as well as hoot you; and that power
it will exercise if you do not conform to its idiotisms; one of which
is, the addition of upholstery to ashes, and drapery to dust.</p>

<p>It would therefore be a great boon to you&#8212;being a wise man, and
likewise an executor or a legatee charged with an interment&#8212;if your
expenditure were subject to be regulated by the subjoined ordinance:&#8212;</p>

<blockquote><p>"In conveying dead bodies to the burial-ground every kind
 of pomp
and publicity shall be avoided."</p></blockquote>

<p>They manage these matters better in Spain, you will say: for this is
one
of the articles of a Royal decree that has been issued at Madrid.</p>

<p>But it is also ordained in the same decree, that</p>

<blockquote><p>"No church, chapel, nor any other sign of a temple or of
public or
private worship will be allowed to be built in the aforesaid
cemetery."</p></blockquote>

<p>Now, the aforesaid cemetery is the Protestant cemetery. And it is
further declared that</p>

<blockquote><p>"All acts which can give any indication of the
performance of any
divine service whatever are prohibited."</p></blockquote>

<p>The above regulations will be found in a Parliamentary paper recently
published, containing official correspondence between <span
class="smcap">General Lersundi</span>
and <span class="smcap">Lord Howden</span>, relative to the Protestant
Cemetery aforesaid at
Madrid. The noble Lord's reply to the gallant officer will be found
highly satisfactory, as conveying to the Spanish Government the
assurance of that distinguished contempt for it, which is due to a set
of imbecile and miserable bigots&#8212;utensils of their priesthood.</p>

<p>One would really think that the clergy of Spain and almost all other
Roman Catholic countries were doing their very utmost to earn the crown
of martyrdom&#8212;not, however, for themselves, but for their ecclesiastical
brethren, together with all the lay partisans of Popery in Protestant
countries. They appear to be trying as hard as they can to prove that
the predominance of their religion is inconsistent with civil freedom.
The struggles, then, so perseveringly made, both in and out of
Parliament, to extend and establish an influence which, wherever it
prevails, is seen to issue in tyranny the most hateful; what can they be
considered but endeavours to spin cobwebs about our liberties? And have
we not every temptation to sweep away the spiders? Resist it, however:
resist it, <span class="smcap">Mr. Bull</span>: don't crush the poor
creatures, but destroy their
webs.</p>

<h2>OUR TOURIST IN PARIS.</h2>

<center>No. 1.</center>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/090.png" alt="T" class="cap" width="30%" />

<p class="cap_3">THE philosophic traveller leaves his native country in
order to study
the manners of "our volatile neighbours." At the London Bridge Station
he finds a crowd of excited persons, evidently bent on the same object.
Every man has a passport in his breast-pocket, and is encumbered with
much unnecessary luggage, including the plate-chest, so indispensable to
the English gentleman's toilet. A foretaste of foreign sights is given
by groups of Frenchmen in beards and moustachios, wrapped in furred
garments of strange fashion, and overcome by nervousness at the varied
dangers which they are about to encounter. Your correspondent, with
proper indifference, reads <i>Punch</i> and the evening papers all the
way to
Dover. His companions are two anxious Gauls, a boy and his tutor, and a
party of exceedingly gay appearance and manners, who has no uniform rule
for the introduction or suppression of his h's. He is perhaps a
traveller in the button or hook-and-eye line.</p>
</div>

<p>At Dover the tourist is turned out into the dark with his companions,
and finds himself in the power of a band of bravoes, who share the
luggage between them, thrust us, the helpless owners, into narrow and
filthy dungeons on wheels, and then, reckless of prayers and menaces,
hold a council upon our fate. We are at length hurried off into deeper
gloom, and the plash of the ocean awakens indefinable apprehensions in
the breasts of all. But we wrong the band&#8212;they are honest as things go,
and will take ransom. A shilling, under pretence of an omnibus ride of a
hundred yards, satisfies one ruffian; a second shilling stays the wrath
of another, who in return mildly slides your portmanteau down a board
into the steamer. This vessel is fuming in great excitement at
everybody's confounded stupidity and slowness. "What on earth are you
waiting for?" it seems to say. "How can you possibly expect me to take
the letters in time? It's all very well for you, you know, but I'm a
public character, and have got a reputation to keep up. Don't stand
loitering there about those things. Pitch 'em in anyhow. Hang the
luggage. What's luggage to letters? You have no idea how important the
mail-service is. I know I'm very passionate, and if you don't come at
once I shall scream."</p>

<p>Ah! the last carpet-bag is in; the bell rings, the bad language
partially ceases, the mooring ropes are cast off, and the fussy old
animal is allowed to have her own way. The philosophic tourist finds his
companions of the train. The tutor is curled up under the table in the
cabin, which is full of sleepers, lying about in every direction like
great flies who have over-eaten themselves. The distinguished foreigners
have already become pale even at the tranquil heaving of the harbour
tide. The hook-and-eye man and the boy are smoking infamous cheroots,
drinking neat cognac, and making pointless jokes in a loud voice to the
steward. We are outside the pier. Your correspondent has no emotions. He
sees the cliffs of Albion diminish without a sigh&#8212;a regret. He does not
feel the poetry of the situation. He omits to quote <i>Childe Harold</i>
to a
gentleman's servant who kindly helps him on with a third great-coat. He
is perhaps brutal; yet he is not without some remains of human
sentiment. The greatest pleasure man can enjoy is to contemplate the
misfortunes of others. Accordingly, he visits the sick. The cabin has
become a hospital&#8212;a Pandemonium. To stay there is impossible, he
returns to the deck. Alas! the furry exiles are paying a bitter tribute
to the ocean. The happier ancients could propitiate <span class="smcap">Neptune</span>
 with a
horse. Now-a-days he has a fancy for human sacrifices, and will only lie
appeased by a portion of ourselves. <span class="smcap">Hooks-and-eyes</span>
 has lost his
disposition to joke, regrets the brandy, curses the cheroot, and sits
down in gloomy silence. The youngster is jollier than ever, and chaffs
his discomfited friend, whom he pronounces in private an awful snob.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the swift steamship cuts through the hissing waves. A south
wind springs up, and we enjoy a pleasant variety of motion. To the
original regular dip and rise which tried so many, is now added a
jerking roll, occasionally amounting to a lurch. "<i>Ah ciel!</i>" gasp
the
expiring Gauls. "Steward, steward!" yells <span class="smcap">Hooks-and-eyes</span>,
 as he flies
across the deck seemingly by some supernatural impulse, and clings
convulsively to the lee bulwarks. "And they said we should have a good
passage," complain half a dozen other wretched beings, who make up a
party to occupy the same position. The philosopher and his young friend
pace the deck as well as they can, and hold sweet conversation. The
artless lad details his ancient lineage, his past at Eton, his future at
Oxford, and the Continental tour which, illustrated by the mild wisdom
of <span class="smcap">Jenkins</span>, M.A., is to fill up the interval
between the two. These
pleasant words make short the voyage. "Mark, my youthful acquaintance,"
says the philosopher, "mark the abject misery of these men. There are
Britons among them, but the first, the feeblest of them all are French.
Rejoice, therefore, for this malady is the Guardian Genius of our
shores. Here are coast-defences more stubborn than Martello towers, more
terrible than militia men, more vigilant even than a Channel fleet.
Figure to yourself an army of red-trowsered invaders in this state
offering to land on English shore, and bless the beneficent
dispensations of nature. And now, perhaps, you will do me the favour of
whistling <i>Rule Britannia</i>. Thank you."</p>

of ship" width="100%" /></a>
</div>

<p>The lights of Calais become rapidly visible, the seas abate, the
groaning invalids recover their legs, the poor sick ladies come up from
the cabin; we glide into smooth water listening to strange cries from
the pier, and finally grate along the quay. We are welcomed to the
strand of France by <i>douaniers</i> in green with round caps, and
policemen
in blue with cocked hats and yellow shoulder-belts. We must try to
admire and love these men, for as long as we remain, they are fated to
be our constant companions. The dilapidated troop of travellers is
marched into a sort of condemned cell, whence a detachment disappears
from time to time to undergo the examination of their passports and
luggage. Here comes the first need of the French tongue. The miserable
foreigners recover something of their importance, and the Britons, proud
of their exemption from the troubles of the sea, begin to find that they
are mortal. <span class="smcap">Hooks-and-eyes</span>, emboldened by
excessive draughts of brandy,
which make him blink and walk unsteadily, becomes a public character by
the wonderful volubility with which he talks an idiom of his own,
perfectly unintelligible to the officials. He fancies, it would seem,
that he is speaking some Continental language. An hour&#8212;two hours&#8212;are
thus cheerfully spent, and we ultimately settle into a train which
ultimately starts. Sleep is rendered impossible by a tin box full of hot
water laid at the bottom of the carriage, which, though it certainly
warms your feet, brings your knees up to your chin, and at last amounts
to an instrument of torture.</p>

<p>The chill of dawn penetrates through voluminous wrappings, and the
grey
light, as it gradually strengthens, renders visible the dreary<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span> face
of
the country and the haggard unshaven countenances of the travellers. Our
young friend, however, is as fresh as a rose and as airy as a lark.
"Why, the sunrise is just like the sunrise in England, only not so fine.
My eye, look at those pigs! what tremendous legs they've got! That black
one is just like a greyhound; he might go for the Derby if he was in
condition. Look, there's a clod in wooden shoes. Ah! none of the
labourers in Leicestershire wear wooden shoes. That's what my governor
said at the last election, when we licked the Freetraders so. Nothing
like the British peasantry, their country's pride, when once&#8212;I forget
how it goes on. Why, they have not got any hedges, just fancy. That
isn't good farming, is it, <span class="smcap">Mr. Jenkins</span>?" That
 Master of Arts, who, under
happier circumstances, might have here given a quotation from <i>Virgil's
Georgics</i>, was meekly prostrate beneath the vicissitudes of travel,
and
quite unable to reply. As we stop at occasional stations we see groups
of happy country people, the women in jackets and white caps, the men in
blouses, mounted in open cars, and laughing and jabbering without end.
Houses become more frequent&#8212;tall, slim, chilly-looking white
structures, with Venetian blinds outside each window. More careful
cultivation marks the proximity of a great market. Finally, we pass deep
ditches, low massive walls, not visible till you are close to them when
you see how enormous they are, a ragged suburb, and we are in Paris. A
fresh searching of luggage, a light one this time, for butter, eggs, and
cabbages, I believe, sets us free&#8212;that is, as free as any one can be
out of dear Old England.</p>

<p>The philosophic traveller here makes one reflection. What assurance a
man must have to bore the British public with the description of a
journey that every one has made, and knows as well as he does the
Greenwich Railway, or the route from Chelsea to the Bank!</p>

<hr />

<h2>ALARMING RAILWAY ACCIDENT.</h2>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/091a.png" alt="A" class="cap" width="25%" />

<p class="cap_3">AN accident, the consequences of which have proved more
 serious than was
at first anticipated, has occurred on the Lancashire and Yorkshire
Railway, the rails and sleepers of which had, we understand, been, for
some time previously, in an insecure condition. The result has been
damages to the amount of above £7,000, incurred by the Company at the
Northern Circuit Assizes for loss of life attributed to that state of
things. As the sufferers in this instance are directors, instead of
stokers or engineers, the calamity will perhaps prove a salutary lesson
to them, by teaching them to make better arrangements for the safety of
the public. Many of the victims, we believe, have wives and families, to
whom, however, it is not apprehended that their loss will prove
unusually distressing.</p>
</div><br />

<center>FURTHER PARTICULARS.</center>

<p>Since the accident, we are informed by our special contemporary, the
<i>Morning Post</i>, that the authorities of the Railway in question</p>

<blockquote><p>"Have issued the following ticket, which passengers on
their
dangerous line are required to sign, and which we here give word for
word as it is printed and issued by these liberal directors:&#8212;</p>

<p>"'This ticket is issued by the Company and accepted by the holder,
upon the express understanding and agreement that the Company are
not to be in any way held responsible to the holder, or his
representatives, for the consequences of <i>any accident, however
caused</i>, which may happen to the holder while travelling in any of
the Company's vehicles, or being at any of the Company's Stations.
It must be exhibited to the Company's Officers whenever required,
and any person using it other than the person named herein will be
liable to the same penalties as a passenger who does not pay his
fare.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>We have no reason for supposing that the above agreement is a hoax,
which has been palmed off upon our contemporary, or that it is a joke at
the expense of those unfortunate people who have been already put to so
much. On our mind there is no doubt of its authenticity. We are sorry to
say we do not think it calculated to answer its purpose; which is to
insure the pockets of the Company against the consequences of those
awful accidents which are inevitable on an unsafe line. In the first
place, we are of opinion that it would not hold good in law. But even if
it were legal, it would only tend to obviate the pecuniary consequences
of accidents, by preventing the accidents from occurring; and that
simply by deterring the public from running the risk of them. To find a
Railway Company demanding to insure their property against his loss of
life or limb, as a condition to taking him as a passenger, is rather
calculated to reduce a man to a sense of the dreadful situation in which
he must place himself by venturing on their line. If they persist in
issuing this precautionary ticket, they might as well, for consistency's
sake, adorn their stations with death's heads and tombstone cherubim,
and cover their platforms with black cloth.</p>

<h4>GREAT SUCCESS OF CLAIRVOYANCE.</h4>

<p>It is perfectly well known, and firmly believed by many of the
gullible,
that some clairvoyants, by the mere inspection of a lock of a patient's
hair, are able to ascertain his complaint and also to prescribe for it,
without having acquired any knowledge of medicine. We are informed by a
person of quality, on whom we can depend, that a certain clairvoyant
having had a portion of hair shown to him the other day, instantly
pronounced the individual it had belonged to a lunatic, and recommended
that the whole head should be shaved. The declaration of the
somnambulist was remarkably verified, and the propriety of his advice
demonstrated, by the fact, that the individual who had owned the hair
turned out to be a gentleman who had been sending conscience money to
the <span class="smcap">Chancellor of the Exchequer</span> "for omitted
Income Tax."</p>

<h4>A Present for Aberdeen.</h4>

<p>The <i>Times</i> correspondent writes that English sailors are dying,

blocked up by the atrocity of Russia. And what says <span class="smcap">Aberdeen</span>?
 Nothing.
We have heard of such visitors as a flea in one's ear; now, by way of a

<p>WEDNESDAY&#8212;MAY 29, 18&#8212;.</p>

<p>"Now, my dear <span class="smcap">Fred</span>&#8212;if I could only feel
certain you were quite ashamed
of yourself, you don't know how comfortable I should be? Call yourself a

use talking, of <i>that</i> I'm determined."</p>

<p>"And so because a foolish young man&#8212;not but what he's a very good
fellow&#8212;<i>will</i> write letters to a silly girl"&#8212;</p>

<p>"Oh, never tell me! He'd never have sent letters and nosegays to <i>such</i>
a person, if she hadn't encouraged him."</p>

<p>"Ha! that's how you women help one another! The man begins the
injury,
and the sister-woman finishes it. No, <span class="smcap">Lotty</span>;
you'll do nothing of the
sort. You'll not part with <span class="smcap">Josephine</span>; and,
more than that, you'll see
young <span class="smcap">Bliss</span> to-day. Who'd have thought to
fight the brother of"&#8212;</p>

<p>"The fisherwoman? Well, it's very odd; I must say it's odd: and if I
<i>do</i> consent to see him, I know I shall only be laughed at."</p>

<p>"Do what's right, <span class="smcap">Lotty</span>; and then you may
laugh with the laughers."</p>

<p>Now there was such good sense in this, that what could I say? Why, I
didn't know; so I just put my arm about his neck.</p>

<p>"Yes, my love, and you'll not crush poor <span class="smcap">Truepenny</span>"&#8212;</p>

<p>"Now, don't ask me that, <span class="smcap">Fred</span>; that is
really too much."</p>

<p>"They'll both be here to-day; and, come, I'll strike a bargain with
you,
<span class="smcap">Lotty</span>?"</p>

<p>"A bargain?" said I. "Why, what's the use, <span class="smcap">Fred</span>,
 when you always get the
best of it? Well, I'm in a foolish good temper, so what is it?"</p>

<p>"If you'll receive young <span class="smcap">Bliss</span>"&#8212;</p>

<p>"But is it really true that <span class="smcap">Miss Bliss</span>&#8212;the
 young lady with the
artificial flies&#8212;is going to be married? Really true?"</p>

<p>"I've told you, I hear next week. That fine young fellow we saw at
the
church, he's the man. When <i>their</i> honeymoon is over, I intend to
ask
them, and young <span class="smcap">Bliss</span>, too, to <i>The Flitch</i>."</p>

<p>"Well?" said I, a little relenting. "And now your bargain?"</p>

<p>"You'll see young <span class="smcap">Bliss</span> and <span
class="smcap">Truepenny</span>&#8212;they'll be here to lunch&#8212;and
we'll start for home, by the first stage to-day, directly afterwards. Is
it a bargain?"</p>

<p>"It's two days earlier than we're looked for," said I.</p>

<p>"Very well, let us stop out the time here," cried <span class="smcap">Fred</span>.</p>

<p>"Not another hour. No; now I shall never be fully happy till I'm at
home. I do verily believe, I shall go upon my knees and kiss the
door-step. So <span class="smcap">Josephine</span> has but to bestir
herself&#8212;I only hope she'll
prove herself worthy of the confidence we place in her; but it's a risk,
<span class="smcap">Fred</span>; depend on it, 'tis a risk."</p>

<p>With this I ran away to my room, and made <span class="smcap">Josephine</span>
 comfortable, telling
her that I thought her a most imprudent, if not a very culpable young
woman, to have nosegays and letters sent to her, and so to destroy the
peace of families&#8212;for it was no use to tell me that she couldn't help
the gentleman sending them, that I <i>couldn't</i> believe;&#8212;but
nevertheless
if, as I believed, she was truly sorry for her conduct, I wouldn't have
the heart to throw her upon the wide, wide world; but would much rather
prefer to take her home with us, and&#8212;if she continued to behave
herself&#8212;to make her happy as the day was long. I said all this; but I
was sorry, really hurt to observe, that the young woman listened to a
good deal I said, like any stone. But then for gratitude, who's to
expect it?</p>

<p>We soon had everything packed, and I returned to <span class="smcap">Fred</span>.
 Was ever anything
so provoking? Instead of <span class="smcap">Mr. Bliss</span> and that <span
 class="smcap">Truepenny</span>, came two letters
of apology. <span class="smcap">Mr. Bliss</span> had received a sudden
call upon his attention that
he must obey, but hoped to be allowed to see <span class="smcap">Fred</span>
 and "his charming
partner"&#8212;(and he'd thought nothing of making her a disconsolate
widow!)&#8212;some day at <i>The Flitch</i>. As for <span class="smcap">Mr.
Truepenny</span>, he declared to
<span class="smcap">Fred</span> that "he had not the courage to meet his
 wife:" which I considered
a very proper compliment to my spirit. I scarcely thought the man had as
much remorse and proper feeling in him. And then he added&#8212;"P.S. I write
this upon my knees, sending my contrition to your estimable partner;
with an earnest prayer that, at some distant day, I may be permitted to
approach her at her own fireside. Dinner is beyond my ambition as above
my deserts: but, I trust, that after due time and penitence, I may hope
to be called to the tea-table. May hope still lift up her azure eyes to
muffins?"</p>

<p>"I really don't see anything to laugh at," said I to <span
class="smcap">Fred</span>, who was
mightily amused as he read the letter. And to say the truth I <i>was</i>
 a
little vexed. Because I had made my mind up to show <span class="smcap">Fred</span>
 how forgivingly
I could behave&#8212;and then to be disappointed of the opportunity <i>was</i>
vexing.</p>

<p>However, we lunched alone; paid the bill; and&#8212;shall I ever forget how
 I
jumped into the carriage? I seemed to have wings!&#8212;and away we trundled
homewards&#8212;homewards!</p>

<p>
<i>Home.</i><br />
</p>

<p>I fairly cried with happiness when I crossed the threshold. When I
dropt
in my chair at my fireside, I felt like the happiest Queen upon her
throne. How beautiful, too, everything looked! There seemed a bloom, a
brightness upon everything in the house; whilst the garden was glowing,
brimming with flowers; all of them nodding at me, as I thought, a
welcome.</p>

<p>What a house-warming we've had! And I never can complain of the
smallness of the house after such a party! A hundred and fifty, and
still plenty of room for <i>Roger de Coverley</i>. Mamma danced with
<span class="smcap">Truepenny</span> who&#8212;the foolish fellow!&#8212;would go
upon his knees on the
hearth, and drink a glass of champagne in honour, as he said, of the
household gods. We've had merriment enough almost for a life! I begin to
be afraid of so much happiness&#8212;can it last?</p>

<p><i>May 1, Twenty-ninth return of Wedding Day.</i></p>

<p>Thankful, grateful, for all blessings! Happiness has continued;
happiness the purest and best, for&#8212;as dear, dear <span class="smcap">Fred</span>
 says&#8212;the
happiness was ever home-made.</p>

<p class="cap_3">WHETHER everybody has his price or not; there are some
quite capable of
selling themselves, even by auction: as, for one instance, we should
think, the author of the subjoined advertisement:&#8212;</p>
</div>

<blockquote><p>AS LEDGER CLERK, Manager, and Correspondent.&#8212;A gentleman,
 of
close-sticking business habits, who does nothing by halves, whose
references as to character, &amp;c., are first-rate, and whose devotion
to his employers' interests ever has been unbounded, is just now
open to a RE-ENGAGEMENT. The advertiser is of ripe, vigorous,
middle-age, and so undeviatingly systematic, as by the restless
force of example, to be qualified to establish, in all around him,
habits of perseverance, self denial, and fagging industry, such as
could not fail to tell wonderfully, as those habits became more and
more fully developed, on any set of people so organised. Clever men
of business, who, one and all, admire cleverness in others, and
especially when it makes to them its own peculiar bow of the most
profound obeisance, are most respectfully requested to address their
replies to <span class="smcap">Alpha Delta</span>, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p></blockquote>

<p>The gentleman so industriously adhesive certainly does not cry
himself
up by halves; and the glowing language in which he describes his age as
"ripe and vigorous," might well become some <span class="smcap">Yankee
George Robins</span>
appraising an <span class="smcap">Uncle Tom</span>. We can vividly
imagine him putting himself up,
ringing the changes on his ripeness and vigour, first-rate references,
undeviatingly systematic ways, close-sticking business habits, and
unbounded devotion to his employers' interests: and ultimately, with his
"own peculiar bow of the most profound obeisance," respectfully knocking
himself down to the best bidder. We should like to buy him at our terms
in this manner, if we could afterwards dispose of him at his own. But
our friend blows his trumpet with rather too many flourishes; makes
overmuch use of the figure hyperbole, to commend himself for employment
in those figures that Ledger Clerks are more particularly concerned
with.</p>

<p>In the same <i>Times</i> that contained the foregoing announcement,
appears
also the following:&#8212;</p>

<blockquote><p>NO SALARY REQUIRED.&#8212;A young Gentleman, (20 years of age),
 author of
several works, wishes for a HOME. He is a beautiful reader and
writer; can write poetry, tales, essays, and anything literary. He
is possessed of pleasing manners, kind disposition, and would do all
in his power to make himself useful, and contribute to the happiness
of those with whom he may become associated. One of his works sent
for six stamps. Address Reginald Villiers, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is a performance on a similar instrument; but it is the
clarionet
to the cornet-à-pistons. Only 20; a "beautiful" reader and writer; can
write poetry, tales, essays, and "anything literary;" and is already the
"author of several works." Why, this is a second</p>

<blockquote><p>"<span class="smcap">Chatterton</span> the marvellous
Boy,"</p></blockquote>

<p>and we should say he had better take care that he does not so far
resemble</p>

<blockquote><p>"The sleepless Soul that perished in his pride,"</p></blockquote>

<p>as to go off, some day, in a fit of vanity and self-conceit.</p>

<p>We are almost inclined to send him six stamps for one of his works,
in
order that we may ascertain if it is worth a single rap.</p>

<h2>THE BRITISH CONSULATE AT BOULOGNE.</h2>

<center>(<i>From our Travelling Contributor.</i>)</center>

<p>The British Consulate at Boulogne still "hangs out" over the
"tinnery,
leadery, and zincery," at the end of the port, as we have ascertained by
a recent visit. The ground floor is occupied by a sauce-pan shop, while
British diplomacy has taken the floor above, and the frontage of the
premises displays a rivalry of attraction between the "British Consular
Office for Passports" and the "<i>Bazar des Quatre</i>" something or
other,
which the tinman adopts as the name of his domicile.</p>

<p>We recognise no change in the arrangements since we noticed the
establishment two years ago, except that the individual who represents
British diplomacy has got a new cap, is rather more civil spoken than he
was, and the boy who runs to call him when he is in another room is
grown bigger than he used to be. This is all natural enough, and so far
unobjectionable, though we are not quite so well satisfied with a rope
that has been attached to one side of the staircase by way of
bannisters. On the day of our visit there was a consular <i>torchon</i>,
 or
diplomatic dishclout hanging to dry on the landing, which we thought
savoured of anything but dignity. The rope was well enough as far as it
went, and the Consul has given the public just rope enough to hang
itself, or rather to pull itself up by, in ascending the staircase. We
presume that all this homeliness is as much as the passport fees will
afford, and we can only regret, for the credit of British diplomacy,
that it is as much dignity as can be sustained upon the
four-and-two-pences that pour in on the establishment at Boulogne.</p>

<h2>LEADING ARTICLE FOR OLD LADIES.</h2>

<center>(<i>On the proposed New Coinage.</i>)</center>

<p>We are, and always were, averse to change. We do not mean to say that
 we
have, or ever had, any objection to those coppers which long custom has
hallowed, and which have been consecrated to charity. But when
innovation would tamper with the coin of the realm, we, in common with
all <span class="smcap">Her Majesty's</span> loyal subjects, are
necessitated to rally round the
<span class="smcap">Sovereign</span>, not only as such, but as
represented by monetary
subordinates. And when we observe that one of the principal features in
the contemplated revolution is the abolition of the Half-Crown, we
cannot but consider the <span class="smcap">Crown</span>, and with the <span
 class="smcap">Crown</span> the <span class="smcap">Throne</span>, and
of
course the <span class="smcap">Church</span> to be placed in jeopardy.
In short, we must record our
emphatic protest against the proposed Decimal Currency. It was under the
old arrangement of pounds, shillings, pence, and farthings, that the
country attained to its present pitch of glory and prosperity. That the
Decimal system has been adopted by foreigners is the very reason why we
should persist in our own. What is it that makes them so eager to take
our money, if not its acknowledged superiority to theirs?</p>

<p>The democratic, indeed the levelling character of the decimal
agitation
is obvious from one remarkable fact, which, may, perhaps, however, be
new to our readers. It is notorious that the lower classes are addicted
to the use of slang or flash language, especially in connection with
pugilism. Now we have already had introduced a coin of foreign
denomination, but domestic orthography. We allude to the piece of money
termed a florin, a word which, as spelt by the populace&#8212;as many of them
as can spell at all&#8212;signifies the act of knocking or being knocked
down. It is proposed that one of the new-fangled coins shall bear the
yet more vulgar appellation of a mil; which in the same vocabulary
signifies a fistic encounter.</p>

<p>From a Parliamentary Commission subservient to a Downing Street gang,
thus evidently deriving the nomenclature of their projected coinage on
the one hand from Continental Jews, Papists, and Infidels; and on the
other from the <span class="smcap">Brummagem Chicken</span> and the <span
 class="smcap">Tipton Slasher</span>, what can we
expect but the overthrow of all our ancient institutions, unless the
blow which they are about to aim at all that we hold tender, be parried
by a determined exertion of the art of self-defence?</p>

<h2>MR. PETERLOO BROWN'S EXAMINATION OF THE OXFORD STATUTES.</h2>

<p class="salute">"<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Punch</span>,</p>

<p>"I venture but once again to trouble you with a few remarks; and, as I
am looking forward to my lad matriculating this next October, I shall be
glad of your speedy advice as to whether I ought to send him to a place

of, and those I am now about to mention.</p>

<p>"The next Statute after 'the herb Nicotiana,' is about the closing of
the College gates at 9 o'clock, and says, that if circumstances should
call for it (<i>si res ita postulet</i>), the Heads of the Houses shall
then
go round to each chamber (<i>perlustratis singulorum cubiculis</i>), to
see
if their tenants are there. This is a delightful rule; and, if
circumstances do <i>not</i> call for the Heads to make their rounds, it
only
shows that the Statute is obeyed without such supervision. Early to bed,
you know, <i>Mr. Punch</i>, not only leads to salubriousness of body and
purse, but also conduces to wisdom of intellect; and, doubtless, much of
the success of the 'Oxford discipline' that we hear so much about may be
traced to this 'early-closing movement.' I am glad to find that my son
<span class="smcap">Peterloo</span> will not have to carry out the
popular idea of a student, by
burning 'the midnight oil'&#8212;which you and I, as men of the world, know
is a mere figure of speech, and only leads to biliousness of body and
cutting of morning chapels&#8212;but that he will have to be in bed by 9
o'clock, and, possibly, may be tucked up by the Head of the College
himself, attended, of course, by bedels and 'holy pokers,' and all the
paraphernalia of Collegiate grandeur. And, <i>Mr. Punch</i>, what an
instructive subject 'Alma Mater putting her children to bed' would be
for <span class="smcap">Mr. Tenniel</span> to turn into a cartoon for
the new Houses of Parliament;
where, in spite of the exertions of <span class="smcap">Mrs.</span>&#8212;I
mean <span class="smcap">Mr.</span>&#8212;<span class="smcap">Brotherton</span>,
 the
Members <i>will</i> waste the gas and their health in keeping late
hours&#8212;a
thing they were plainly never allowed to do as long as they were at
Oxford!</p>

</div>

<p>"The next Statute not only forbids the students to indulge in all
games
that might be hurtful to themselves (<i>abstineant ab omni lusus genere,
in quo de pecuniâ concertatur</i>), but also requires them to abstain
from
every kind of game or sport which might cause any danger, injury, or
inconvenience to others; as, for example, from the hunting of wild
beasts with dogs of all kinds, with ferrets, nets, or snares (<i>item
quod
abstineant ab omni genere lusus vel exercitu, ex quo aliis periculum,
injuria, vel incommodum creatur: veluti a venatione ferarum cum canibus
cujuscunque generis, viverris, retibus, aut plagis</i>). Oh, <i>Mr.
Punch</i>,
does Oxford still keep the same position it held in dark centuries ages
ago, that it is forced to make its matriculating candidates swear to
abstain from the sports of a savage life, which may be all very well for
a <span class="smcap">Gordon Cumming</span>, but do not accord with the
peaceful pursuits of a
cloistered student? And what, I would ask, are the wild beasts for which
Oxford is famous? Are they of the same genus as those which my young
neighbour <span class="smcap">Bellingham Grey</span> speaks of? He tells
 me that Oxford is infested
with the varied species of the Ornithorhyncus&#8212;<i>the Beast with a
Bill</i>&#8212;which usually lurk in dens to which they endeavour, by many
allurements, to entice their victims; and that, so cunning are they,
that they will even steal within the College walls and attack a Student
in his own private room, and cannot be got away before they have made
him bleed freely. He says that there is no way of capturing these
beasts, and that they can only be kept off by Degrees; but, that when
once you have found means to settle them, their Bill immediately drops
off; and that they are not seen again until their bill has been
curiously renewed. I wonder that the manager of the Zoological Gardens
don't get hold of specimens of this very curious beast, the Oxford
Ornithorhyncus; more especially as they seem to be so common. But I
suppose that their difficulty of capture at present stands in the way.
But, who knows, but what we shall see them next season among the 'lions'
of the Gardens, and eclipsing in interest even the vivarium and the
hippopotamus?</p>

<p>"But to return to the Statute. Though I think I smell a badger, yet
the
word 'ferrets' seems to point at rats. But if, in their humanity, the
authorities discourage rat-hunting&#8212;which, of course, must be an
'inconvenience' to the rat, even if it cause him no 'danger or
injury'&#8212;why do they shut their eyes to the legions of terriers, and
other rat-killing dogs, that are openly possessed by the members of the
University? I am at a loss to know for what species of wild beasts the
'snares and nets' are intended, unless the young men poach for rabbits
and hares. But as for fox-hunting, I shall know now how far I may
believe young <span class="smcap">Bellingham Grey</span> when he says
that he, and more than a
score of 'pinks' may be seen in a morning, setting off from the
Canterbury Gate of Christ Church! And as for the loo, and whist, and
'Van John' that he speaks of, not to mention écarté, and the money that
changes hands in one evening, why I am sadly afraid that the young
gentleman has been imposing upon my credulity.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Nobody must carry a cross-bow, and a hawk for
fowling.</span></h4>
</div>

<p>"The Statute goes on to forbid the boys&#8212;I beg pardon, the 'men!'&#8212;from
the use of hawks for fowling, and from the carrying of cross-bows and
'Bombardarum' (<i>necnon ab omni apparatu et gestatione Bombardarum, et
arcubalistarum; sive etiam accipitrum usu ad aucupium</i>). Now, I am
aware
that the old noble sport of hawking is being revived, because I take in
<i>The Field</i> (for, of course, I look upon myself as a 'country
gentleman,' and do everything that country gentlemen ought to do), and
in <i>The Field</i> I sometimes read about it; and I suppose the Oxford
gentlemen are assisting in the revival. But, in the name of wonder, <i>Mr.
Punch</i>, what <i>can</i> be meant by 'Bombardarum?' Has it anything to
 do with
your Austrian friend '<span class="smcap">Bomba</span>?' Or does it mean
 that the young men must
not carry about mortars for the discharge of bombs, or battering-rams,
or some 'bombarding' implement 'of that ilk?' But no. 'Town and Gown'
disturbances can never need such warlike preparations as these. I
suppose I must write to your facetious contemporary <i>Notes and Queries</i>,
and ask what 'Bombardarum' really does mean; for no Latin Dictionary
that I have access to is able to inform me. Really, <i>Mr. Punch</i>, my
 <span class="smcap">Lord
Chancellor Derby</span> ought to publish either a translation of the
Statutes
of his University or a dictionary of these 'Oxford mixture' phrases,
'<i>canino Anglico Latine reddita</i>:' for how can young men be
expected to
obey Statutes which are made up of words of which the meaning can only
be conjectured? And if, <i>Mr. Punch</i>, you take up the cudgels for
the
Oxford Statutes, and tell me that they are thus purposely framed, and
after the fashion of the Statutes of the country, I beg to observe that
the seat of learning ought to be stuffed with other stuff than that
which fills the woolsack, and that the framers of its laws should not be
like the noble and versatile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104"

<p>"The statutes next call upon the matriculating candidate to swear
that
he will keep aloof from all rope-dancers and actors, and from the
strifes and shows of&#8212;gladiators! (<i>Item quod, intra Universitatem
Oxoniensem aut Præcinctum, absque speciali veniá Vice-Cancellarii, nec
Funambuli nec Histriones, qui quæstús causâ in Scenam prodeunt, nec
Gladiatorum certamina sive spectacula permittantur; nec Academici eisdem
intersint.</i>) Good gracious, <i>Mr. Punch</i>! is this the nineteenth
century&#8212;is <i>Punch</i> an institution of our land; have we got a Camp
at
Chobham, and a Fleet at Spithead, or are we <span class="smcap">Rip Van
Winkles</span> in an
inverse degree, who have slept backwards into the past? My brain is
fairly <i>muddled</i>, Sir, with the thought that I am about to send my
son
<span class="smcap">Peterloo</span> to a place which I had fondly
imagined to be the centre of all
enlightenment, and which I now find retains the barbarities of the
darkest ages. I don't object to the rope-dancers and actors&#8212;although I
might perhaps be inclined to ask why <span class="smcap">Shakspeare</span>,
 and <span class="smcap">Sheridan</span>, and
<span class="smcap">Bulwer-Lytton</span> should be condemned as
improper; and <span class="smcap">Plautus</span>, <span class="smcap">Terence</span>,
 and
<span class="smcap">Juvenal</span> decided to be the only pure and
proper dramatic guides of
youth&#8212;I don't object, I say, to my lad going to see the rope-dancing
and acting, but I do decidedly object to his even having a chance of
obtaining 'the special permission of the Vice-Chancellor' to be present
at such degrading exhibitions as the 'sports of the Gladiators.' I
shudder to think (and so does <span class="smcap">Mrs. Brown</span>,
Sir), that my lad, who has
been so carefully brought up, will <i>really</i> 'see before him the
Gladiator lie, his manly form all cover'd o'er with wounds;' and that he
will, perhaps&#8212;(I can assure you, Sir, that <span class="smcap">Mrs.
Brown</span> is obliged to
have recourse to her smelling salts at the bare thought of such
horrors)&#8212;that he will perhaps set his own slave (or scout) to fight for
his amusement, and, like those frightful Romans that he is obliged to
read about, will be turning up his thumbs to give the dreadful signal
for his wretched servant's death! I must really pause a moment to
recover my equanimity. Yet a bright thought strikes me! Perhaps, after
all, <i>Mr. Punch</i>, these gladiatorial exhibitions are only intended
to
assist the students in their classical pursuits, the mind being, we
know, often more speedily instructed through an appeal to the eye. And
this idea is supported by the words of the Statute that the Students
must not be present at such shows without the special permission of the
Vice-Chancellor. For, of course, if there <i>are</i> no gladiatorial
exhibitions in Oxford, the candidates for matriculation would not be
required to take oaths about them.</p>

<p>"It would fatigue both you and me, <i>Mr. Punch</i> (weakened as I
feel by
these gladiatorial prospects), were I to make more lengthy observations
on the Oxford Statutes; for the subject is so copious, that it would
take me some time to travel through all the <i>Statutum ests</i>, and
stop at
each. Yet I think I have told you enough about them to enable you to
give me your valuable opinion on the propriety and wisdom of suffering
my son <span class="smcap">Peterloo</span> to enter an university, to
the privileges of which he
will only be admitted on the condition that he swears to observe all the
foregoing Statutes, and a host of others, to the utmost of his power:
'<i>Scito te</i>,' says the Vice-Chancellor, as he gives the young man a
 copy
of the book which I have now been considering, '<i>Scito te in
matriculam
Universitatis hodie relatum esse, sub hac conditione, sempe, ut omnia
Statuta, hoc libro comprehensa, pro virili observes</i>.'</p>

<p>"But I will add one word in favour of a few more Statutes of this
'<i>Tit.</i> XV.' I am glad to see that, while my son will not be
permitted
to draw a weapon upon another, or threaten him with a knife, dagger,
sword, or other species of weapon (<i>cultellum, pugionem, gladium, aut
aliquot aliud genus teli aut distrinxerit, aut intentaverit, cum minis,
&amp;c.</i>), yet, that he will be allowed to bear a bow and arrow for
the sake
of honest recreation (<i>qui honestæ recreationis causá arcus cum
sagittis
portaverint</i>), and will not be suffered to ride in, or be the
charioteer
of, any vehicle, unless he is permitted to do so by the Proctors or the
Heads of his College, on account of his infirm health, or some other
reasonable cause (<i>nisi cui propter infirmam valetudinem aut
rationabilem aliquam causam licentia, &amp;c.</i>). And yet, <i>Mr.
Punch</i>, why
does young <span class="smcap">Bellingham Grey</span> tell me tales of
Traps, and Dog-carts, and
Tandems, and Teams? Have <i>all</i> their charioteers infirm health? or

<h2>FLOWERS OF THE TOWZERY PLANT.</h2>

<p>In these days of steam we encounter a great deal of puffing, but few
probably have beheld the largest locomotive emit so extensive a puff as
the subjoined:&#8212;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Grand, Fortentous, and Most Auspicious Event. Speedy and
 Imperative
and Peremptory Sale of the Entire Stock of Shawls, Mantles, and
Robes, of</p></blockquote>

<p>a firm that we will take the liberty of calling <span class="smcap">Messrs.
 Hokes and Co.</span></p>

<p>In the first place, <span class="smcap">Messrs. Hokes</span> are to
be congratulated on having
introduced a striking novelty into the English language&#8212;the word
Fortentous; which, being big and indistinct, looms, as it were, at the
head of their advertisement, with a misty sublimity.</p>

<p>The nature of the impending event, denominated "fortentous" is thus
elucidated:&#8212;</p>

<blockquote><p>"In consequence of the Proprietors being made Sole Agents
 for
<span class="smcap">Macintosh's</span> Registered Waterproof Dupallas,
for Ladies' Sea-side,
Yachting, or Travelling Wear, they are determined to clear off their
entire Stock&#8212;and, doing this, they sink all Personal Interest,
forego every consideration of gain or lucre, renounce every motive
but the one Grand Object&#8212;that of a positive and absolute Clearance
of the entire Stock&#8212;and this, they are determined, must, will, nay
shall be accomplished, as the Dupalla will be ready for Inspection
in a few days."</p></blockquote>

<p>This paragraph is a masterly composition&#8212;the very perfection of the
insinuating style. Sinking all personal interest, foregoing every
consideration of gain or lucre, renouncing every motive but that of
desiring the positive and absolute clearance of a quantity of
stock&#8212;that "one grand object" might obviously be accomplished in a
simple and effectual manner by making a bonfire of the goods; which,
moreover, would probably be the best thing to do with them.</p>

<p>The conclusion of <span class="smcap">H. and Co.'s</span> Puff at
once invites criticism&#8212;and
defies it&#8212;</p>

<blockquote><p>"But words are but words, after all, so <span
class="smcap">H. &amp; Co</span>. will proceed to lay
before the Public something of a more tangible nature. They pass on
to facts, and facts are stubborn things, but they unhesitatingly
affirm that the incontrovertible facts given in the annexed
quotations of prices, only require ocular observation to establish
their identity."</p></blockquote>

<p>The stubbornness of <span class="smcap">H. and Co</span>.'s facts is
only exceeded by their
acquisitiveness; and perhaps, indeed, the latter propensity may be
considered to have dictated their entire advertisement.</p>

<p>The traveller whose philosophy has passed through these severe
trials,
hungry, dirty, unshaved, weary, almost querulous, hurls his baggage and
himself into a venerable and heavy hackney coach (such a one as <span
class="smcap">Dr.
Johnson</span> might have hired to take <span class="smcap">Mrs. Thrale</span>
 to the play), drawn by a
pair of ragged grey ponies painfully over the rocky ways, which people
here have the face to call a pavement. Half-an-hour's jolting brings him
to the Hotel in the Rue de Richelieu, where he demands a lodging. "But
yes, Monsieur can have a chamber, but certainly," is the cheerful
announcement of the <i>concierge</i>, a very pearl among women, who
advances
from the lodge with a smile to welcome the travel-stained, ill-favoured
guest. "Behold the steward who will make Monsieur know." "Give yourself
the pain to mount, Monsieur," says a solemn official in a fur-cap, with
a reverence. The traveller wearily ascends hundreds of shiny, slippery
steps, till he arrives at the third floor, where he pauses out of
breath. "Mount, mount always!" says the respectable conductor. "But
Monsieur, behold us who are arrived at the fourth. This is in fine
enough, is it not?" "But no, Monsieur, pardon; it is necessary to mount
always." The traveller's hind legs are awfully done up; nevertheless,
<i>allons</i>! we arrive at another floor. "Behold, Monsieur," gaily
says the
steward, as he opens the door of 299.</p>

<p>The first thing that strikes one is, that the last gentleman must
have
been addicted to chewing garlic, and smoking very bad tobacco. The
windows, which appear not to have been opened for weeks, enable the
fastidious English nostrils to analyse these flavours with unerring
certainty. A little hall of entrance, furnished with a stove, a table,
and a bench which seems intended for the repose of exhausted creditors
before they make their unsuccessful appeal to milord, leads to an
apartment furnished both as bed-room and sitting-room, with great taste
and cheerfulness. The chairs are pretty in form, and covered with maroon
velvet. There is a walnut table, escritoire, and chest of drawers. Over
the chimney-piece of black marble is a mirror and a clock. (There is not
a room in Paris which does not boast a looking-glass and a clock or
clocks, though the latter may not go.) In a recess is a bed, which turns
out to be perfect. The last detail, however, strikes the traveller with
horror. He will be forced to wash with a slop basin and a milk jug. What
to do? The official in the fur cap listens with smiling courtesy to the
expostulations of Monsieur, but cannot comprehend his meaning.</p>

<p>There are excellent baths in the Rue Vivienne. But in the chamber?
Ah,
good, they shall bring a hot bath to Monsieur at three francs. It is
still something else? The English waiter shall mount to Monsieur. A
shower-bath, a hip-bath, or a sponging-bath he hath not seen, neither
can he conceive. The philosopher straightway orders a hot bath, and
makes a note never to leave his country for the future without a
collapsible caoutchouc arrangement, which may so far make him
independent of the short-comings of continental civilisation. The
respectable steward retires, the hot bath arrives, painfully supplied
with water by a groaning gentleman in a blouse who evidently hates his
business, especially in its <i>higher walks</i>. Perhaps he will be a
member
of a Provisional Government some day, and pay society off for his
present griefs.</p>

<p>Under the potent influence of hot water the traveller gradually
returns
to his usual serenity. The bravos of Dover, the exhibitions of weakness
on board the steamer, the bureaucratic tediousness of the <i>douaniers</i>,
the insolence of the police, the jolting over the <i>pavé</i>, the
interminable flights of stairs, all fade from his memory as he simmers
into a happier and more tranquil world of thought. Mysterious analogy to
the miracles of culinary science! His heart, so to speak, stews into
tenderness in like manner as the lobster, hideous and savage, gradually
is divested of his gross nature till he becomes the delicate inmate of a
Mayonnaise. Full of this pathetic thought the sage reaps his chin,
anoints his hair, makes an elaborate toilette, and descends like <span
class="smcap">Jupiter</span>
from Olympus to mingle with men of lower earth. He returns with
confidence the smiling salute of the <i>concierge</i>. Ah, Madame! you
may
now regard us; we carry fair linen, and smell of sweet odours: we are no
longer a disgrace to Albion. An astounding breakfast, and so to the
Boulevards.</p>

<p>How much alike men are! Here are a few more Leicester Squarers than
one
sees in Regent Street. The gentlemen wear plaited trowsers and
broad-brimmed hats, and turn-down collars; women of the lower class walk
about in caps; here and there is a blouse, and that is pretty nearly all
the difference to be seen. To what end should we describe an ordinary
Frenchman? Have we not seen him?&#8212;have we not noted him? What child is
ignorant of his unobtrusive costume, his pantaloons full round his hips
and covering all his boots, his pockets half way down his leg, his
tight-waisted coat, his dubious linen, his not dubious hands and face,
his modest gait and diffident manner? Know we not his hair grotesquely
short or filthily long, his stubbly moustache and beard, or imperial, or
republican; his high cheekbones,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106"
id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span> his eyebrows running up on each side;
his vehement discourse, his grimaces, his shrugs, his lively gestures?
Mark those three <i>flâneurs</i>! They are talking each as loud as he
can on
a different topic, not listening or listened to, yet perfectly happy and
content. Would any one but a Frenchman call such monkey-jabber
conversation&#8212;<i>and like it</i>?</p>

<p>They slacken their talk a little, to exhibit the national politeness.
 A
lady, young, charming, and dressed to perfection, though a little more
sumptuously than is usual with us for the promenade on foot, must
descend into the kennel (a little river) if these Messieurs will not
give place. Ah, bah! do not derange yourselves. <span class="smcap">Jules</span>
 puts his head
under her bonnet, and perfumes her exquisite coiffure with tobacco
smoke. <span class="smcap">Adolphe</span> and <span class="smcap">Horace</span>
 exchange <i>bon mots</i> with a coarse laugh, and
the poor lady makes her escape as she may. Oh, French politeness! truly
thou art a thing of the past. The modern Gaul has still the trick of
taking off his hat; but the spirit of courtesy is evaporated, leaving
nothing but dregs behind.</p>

<p>Your correspondent leaves this last sentence as he wrote it in the
heat
of indignation (if his temper is capable of heat) at what <i>could not</i>
have happened in England. Mindful, however, of the danger of drawing
general conclusions from particular premises, he wishes to limit his
censure to French officials and French Boulevard <i>flâneurs</i>, the
only
persons that have as yet shown themselves to deserve it, and who may be
unfavourable specimens of their countrymen. Certainly he has met with an
obliging good humour in waiters and shop-keepers, that contrasts
favourably with the reserved and almost sullen air of the same classes
in England. On the other hand, carters and cabmen seem brutally cruel to
their cattle, and will drive over a foot passenger (especially, perhaps,
if an Englishman) without scruple. Who shall correctly appreciate these
things?</p>

turns out to have been Scotched not killed; as he is now roaring and
bellowing more ridiculously than ever, in the character of the Lion of
North Britain or Scotch Lion. He is clamouring not only for what he
conceives to be his proper corner on the Royal flag, but also, on behalf
of his baronetage and some other connexions, for the whole territory and
fishing-grounds of the Royal Province of New Scotland, as he calls it;
that is to say, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and the adjacent regions. We
expect very soon to hear this foolish old Lion roar for the moon, in a
state of second cubhood. To humour him, however, it might be advisable
to depict him wherever he wishes in that state of rampancy which he
chooses to figure in, that is, in an attitude of rampant absurdity.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Clear, and grey the day is dawning, free from each
ill-omened warning,</p>
<p class="i0">And the sharp fresh air of morning blows upon our mountain
 way,</p>
<p class="i0">As o'er brook and chasm springing, or up woody crag-sides
swinging,</p>
<p class="i0">Showers of dew and blossom bringing down from each rich
laden spray;</p>
<p class="i0">While the birds from tree and thicket greet us with a
jocund lay,</p>
<p class="i0">Merrily our band advancing, towards the mountain's summit
glancing,</p>
<p class="i0">Sees the early sunbeams dancing on a dome of burnished
flame,</p>
<p class="i0">Where, with open doors entreating our approach, a cordial
greeting</p>
<p class="i0">Angel voices seem repeating, singing, sloth and fear to
shame,</p>
<p class="i0">"Hasten! favoured mortals; hasten upward to the House of
Fame!"</p>
<p class="i0">Pausing now, in contemplation, I perceive that every
nation,</p>
<p class="i0">From each calling, class, or station, sends its quota to
our band;</p>
<p class="i0">Poets jostling grave logicians; botanists by politicians;</p>
<p class="i0">Soldiers marching with physicians; kings, with hermits
close at hand</p>

grand conclusion draws;</p>
<p class="i0">From the greatest and the least of Nature's works the
Common Cause</p>
<p class="i0">And purpose of them all divining. "Sages, in a well

<p class="i0">And as thus, with collimators, syphons, hydro-incubators,</p>
<p class="i0">Seismoscopes and insulators, stuffed birds, insects, ferns
 and grasses,</p>
<p class="i0">Microscopic preparations, tons of fire-new publications,</p>

<p class="i0">In one picture, as a fitting tribute to the House of Fame.</p>
<p class="i0">Now the glens and gorges clearing, and on steep bare
slopes appearing</p>

below,</p>

<p class="i0">Changes, on the observation that some men we do not know</p>
<p class="i0">Have crept up by other paths, and share our glory as we
go.</p>
<p class="i0">And these interlopers blending thoughts of fame and pelf
are vending</p>

<h2>NEW AMERICAN MOVEMENT.</h2>

<p>Somebody writing from Naples, about Music, to a fashionable
contemporary, says:&#8212;</p>

<blockquote><p>"I know, too, more than half-a-dozen Americans who have
left their
gold cupidity behind them, and are now in Italy, living in small
dirty back rooms with a piano-forte, practising <i>solfeggios</i>, with
the intention of becoming singers of Italian opera."</p></blockquote>

<p>The development and cultivation of music in the soul of America may,
perhaps, tend to arrest the progress of Filibusterism, and other
stratagems and spoils; including the spoliation of black liberty: and to
render the airs which <span class="smcap">Jonathan</span> sometimes
gives himself&#8212;on the fishery
question for instance&#8212;tolerable. But it will in all probability produce
results yet more extraordinary. A go-ahead people will not be content to
stop short at operas and concerts. Music will be utilized; applied to
political and social purposes; employed to enhance the charms of
eloquence, and adorn the wisdom of statesmanship. Patriots will sing
bravuras at caucus or in Congress on behalf of freedom: and Presidents
will express themselves in notes arranged to form symphonies; whilst the
foreign policy of the States will take the form of overtures. The
unseemly contests which sometimes occur in the Legislature will be
replaced by grand scenas; and the stump-orator that now is will become a
stump-warbler: whilst the mob will respond in chorus. American song will
be famous all the world over, and command immense engagements, being
paid for&#8212;as no doubt it will be delivered&#8212;through the nose.</p>

<h2>A BISHOP IN DISTRESS.</h2>

<p>It is seldom that signals of distress are hoisted from the episcopal
bench; but the signals in question have actually been hung out recently
on behalf of the <span class="smcap">Bishop of Durham</span>. One of the
 "friends of the Church"
has made the melancholy calculation that the good Bishop is in such an
impoverished state that, after making sundry deductions, the
poverty-stricken prelate has scarcely more than seven thousand a year to
live upon. Considering how bishoprics go in the present day, we are
astonished how the prelacy of Durham can pay at the price, and how, in
fact, the bishop can manage to do it for the money.</p>

<p>We shall probably be told next that it is a losing concern, and that
the
occupant of the wretchedly seedy see is about to give it up in
consequence of his being "out of pocket." We recommend the Bench of
Bishops to fraternise with the cabmen in making one common stand against
the system of reduced fares to which both have been doomed in obedience
to the modern principles of economy. The Bench may object to the
association, but it is clear there is some affinity between the
episcopal and the other class, for the cabman can drive his horse, while
both cabman and bishop can drive a bargain.</p>

<h4>A Mysterious Visitor.</h4>

<p>Among the recent visitors to London we find notified an
extraordinarily
dense fog. This visitor, though somewhat obscure, created considerable
sensation, and a sort of general illumination was got up by the London
shopkeepers on the occasion. The fog arrived by the Thames, and made so
much of the short time of remaining that the visitor was nearly all over
London in a very brief period.</p>

<h4>Standing by their Orders.</h4>

<p>Frenchmen having foreign orders are, by a recent decree, to be
allowed
henceforth to wear them. If the French boot-maker in Regent Street
should really wear all the foreign orders he receives he will be papered
from head to foot, and it will be necessary for him to wear an
additional placard requesting bill-stickers to beware, to prevent them
from mistaking him for a hoarding on which bills may be exhibited.</p>

<h2>CHINA AND BACK&#8212;IN NO TIME!</h2>

<p>The Chinese revolution threatens to lead to other revolutions, not
only
in England, but in Europe generally. As prognosticated by the <i>Times</i>,
tourists are making quite a rush to the Celestial Empire. The <span
class="smcap">Chum-li's</span>,
<span class="smcap">Choo-hoons</span>, <span class="smcap">Mar-ch-banks</span>,
 and other Belgravian mandarins have already
beat a precipitate retreat from Paris, Baden-Baden, and such
common-place places, and have arrived at their respective mansions with
a view to arrange passages to Pekin by the "tidal trains." Valets are
busy packing and directing port-mantchoos (oh!) for the scene of the
contentions of the <span class="smcap">Mantchoo</span> dynasty, and the
youthful scions of
Belgravia are already letting their tails grow in anticipation of the
tour. To these latter, <i>Punch</i> would whisper a caution: <i>they eat
 little
dogs in China</i>. "Chinese in six lessons," "Chinese without a master,"
may now be seen placarded everywhere; while our old friend <span
class="smcap">Dr. Bowring</span>
is busily engaged, and will shortly publish a Pekin guide book, with
dialogues for every possible occasion, which will enable the reader to
distinguish a Joss house from a Pagoda, and to ask for a "little more
bird's nest," in the most approved accent. Those who are prevented by
business or means from visiting this new fashionable resort, will
doubtless become familiar with the manners and customs of Pekin through
the medium of panoramas, or by becoming guests at the Feast of Lanterns
and the flow of oil, as held at the Surrey Zoological.</p>

should fight for
considerably the best Christian of the two. Who was the better

or the Turk, who at the cannon's mouth protected them?</p>

 we will give him an
historical sketch of Philosophy generally, with biographies of its
principal professors, and an analysis of their corresponding or
contradicting tenets. He also wants to know what is good for corns, and
he particularly desires answers to both his requisitions this week.&#8212;On

second to any Chiropodist.</p>

some one has been hoaxing you about the four Turkeys. To your second
enquiry, about "the directest way for you to become a Member of
Parliment" (usually spelt Parliament), we reply that you had better
commence by an educational process, which you cannot take up at too
early a stage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robert Bloggs.</span>&#8212;We never before met with

<p>We agree with you in thinking that they are probably from some play.
But
perhaps some of our readers can furnish the information.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albinia E. M.</span> has no reason to be "afraid"
 of our "sarcastic speeches."
We never make any. Besides, her handwriting is very pretty, and we dare
say corresponds with her face. But in reference to her petition that we
will "manage to introduce her to some nice, clever man, with dark eyes,
at least £400 a year, and a turn for music," we must pause. Is she sure
she is in earnest? Our young men do not like their affections to be
sported with. Let her ask her own heart, write again, abstain from
sealing with a fourpenny bit, and spell "intense" with an "s," not a
"c."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amor Virtutis</span> is informed that we cannot
tell him where to get skeleton
keys made.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Non mi ricordo</span>, and numerous other
correspondents are apprised that we
believe the lady was born about the end of the reign of King George the
Second. But her address is in the <i>Court Guide</i>, and they had
better
apply to her personally. We do not profess to keep a Register Office.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Saucy Lizzy.</span>&#8212;The best cosmetic is health.
Rise early, take exercise,
read <i>Punch</i>, and be asleep before dark, and you will not need
"washes,"
which, as the <i>Vicar of Wakefield</i> says, do no end of mischief. But
 if
you must use anything of the kind, a little cantharides and mustard,
rubbed into a paste with turpentine, laid on over night, and the face
washed with sulphuric acid in the morning, will probably produce an
alteration. But, Lizzy, on no account use it unless made up by a
chemist.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Youthful Aspirer.</span>&#8212;We happen, at this
moment, to want neither "poetry"
<i>nor</i> "a boy as can black boots and run errands," but should a
vacancy
occur in either department, we will bear you in mind. Your "Lines to the
Two Warrens" scarcely do justice either to the Blacking or the Blackwood
one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">J. Wheeler Blashby</span> (or some such
name).&#8212;How can <i>we</i> tell you where to
get a hippopotamus? But we could tell you where to get a writing master,
who would be a much better "companion for your leisure hours."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Musidora.</span>&#8212;We need hardly say that we do
recognise the hand, and with
pleasure. Your grace's secret is, of course, perfectly safe with us, and
we should write privately, but have no right to disturb a lady's
<i>incog.</i> As your grace is pleased to prefer periwinkles we must
bow, but
a good deal may be said for whelks. We cannot, however, concur in your
opinion of the music of <i>Rigoletto</i>, which we must, with all
deference,
pronounce "stunning." Your enclosure shall be duly forwarded to the
Marquis.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Archimedes.</span>&#8212;Yes, logarithms and decimals
mean the same thing, and to
reduce decimals into the concrete formula of logarithms, it is only
necessary to extract the cube root and take the middle term (of course
omitting fractions) until the tangents have for their basis the sine of
the complement. Any charity boy could show you the process.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">S. F.</span> (Leeds).&#8212;We are surprised at such
ignorance in a place of
progress like Leeds. The Letters of Junius were not written by any man,
but by Lady Mary Wortley Montague, who conveyed them to the press
through her friend John Evelyn, author of the poem of <i>Silver</i> (on
which
Phillips founded his, of the <i>Splendid Shilling</i>), and she took the
 name
of Junius as a sort of joke, because at the time of writing them she
wore one of the Brutus crops introduced at the French Revolution.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Robinson.</span>&#8212;Rather, and before you
could mention your own name. But
when you send us grouse, send a leash, not a brace.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Macdonald Paul</span> says, that the family of
Skirwharmlie is Scotch, and its
members have been worthy to rank with many of whom Scotia is most proud.
Owing to the unfortunate prejudices of past ages against treason, arson,
cattle stealing, and the like, the family was continually decimated by
judicial interposition, but its representative keeps, or kept (for the
police are very tyrannical) a marine store shop near Old Gravel Lane.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose and Matilda.</span>&#8212;Very much ashamed of
both of you. To write to two
officers whom you do not know, making them offers of marriage, might,
under certain circumstances, be defended. But to tie your letters to the
necks of two kittens, and to fling the inoffensive creatures in at the
military party's windows, was contrary to all etiquette. Pray abstain
from such demonstrations, if you wish us to think you ladies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Heir-at-Law.</span>&#8212;We are afraid we cannot
assist you in tracing your
relative. There was, we think, a person named Smith living either in
Clapham or Shoreditch during the early part of the present century, and
you might search the registries of the churches there. It may aid you in
identifying the party, if we add that he was in the habit of smoking a
good deal on Saturday evenings. We shall be happy if our information
enables you to recover your estate and title.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Runic.</span>&#8212;Your lines are very pretty, and
shall appear as soon as ever we
can make room for them, probably in September or October, 1873. You need
not wait until their appearance before sending the game.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juvenis.</span>&#8212;The epigram is by <span
class="smcap">Martial</span>, and runs, correctly, thus:&#8212;</p>

<blockquote>
<i>Spes primâ facie largo factotum amicus,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Curiæ per contra nil desperandum gratis.</span></i>
</blockquote>

<p>Which may be translated&#8212;but, on second thoughts, we invite our young
classical friends to send us in their translations of this very terse
and sparkling epigram. The name of the first and second best shall be
given, as also that of the worst, if he lets us know it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joshua R.</span>&#8212;We are not aware that the
"Finding the Dead Body of Harold"
has ever been made the subject of a painting, but now you have suggested
it, we have no doubt that some artist will take the idea with
thankfulness. We are always glad to be the vehicle for conveying such
hints, and may mention that we have often wondered that neither <i>Gil
Blas</i>, nor the <i>Vicar of Wakefield</i> has supplied subjects for
painters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Murphy.</span>&#8212;We do not profess to be
weatherwise, but we believe that it has
been observed, that before rain swallows fly high, dogs are unusually
brisk and active and will not eat grass, waterfowl keep on the surface
of the water, fish bite greedily, toads disappear, and sheep and cattle
seem remarkably calm and comfortable. We can hardly tell you "how to
avert the consequences of rain," but a good deal might be done by
staying within doors.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Mother.</span>&#8212;Your excuse is a common one, but
 it is your business to know
that he is out. Respecting the demand of your youngest son for cigar
money and a latch key, we think you perfectly justified in refusing
either until he is eight years old. And though we consider all coercion
as objectionable, we cannot blame you for fastening the street door
top-bolt, which is above his reach, to prevent his going alone to
Vauxhall at half-past eleven at night. But beware of severity, and talk
to him of the beauty of virtue, and the social advantages of
subordination.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Backfin.</span>&#8212;Sturgeon abound in the Hampstead
ponds, but as they belong to
the Lord of the Manor, Sir T. M. Wilson, no one will fish for them. We
have ourselves taken salmon, in the New River, of from sixty to eighty
pounds, but the tall iron railings sadly interfere with an artistic
throw of the fly. We doubt whether the fine trout you describe can be
caught in Peerless Pool. From off the terrace of the Houses of
Parliament, now that the session is over, anglers are seen hooking John
Doreys and smelts daily, but it is stated that the fag ends of the
members' cigars have given them a cabbagy flavour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Novice.</span>&#8212;Always happy to give any
information on etiquette. If you are
on the top of an omnibus, and see a lady walking, to whom you are but
slightly known, call out "Hi!" and kiss your hand to her in a facetious
manner. If she be of superior rank, it is usual, though not necessary,
to put your hat on the end of your stick and spin it round, but
discretion must be your guide. True politeness is that which places
every one at ease.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ada Jane.</span>&#8212;We suspect poor <span
class="smcap">Ada Jane</span> is in rather an awkward position. We
cannot see how she is to prevent her cousin's marriage with the young
nobleman to whom <span class="smcap">Ada Jane</span> herself has taken a
 liking. She might,
certainly, go to the intended bride's mother, represent her own
feelings, and ask her to give up the cousin's brilliant match&#8212;such
things are done on the stage. But we doubt whether it would do in
Belgravia. Let <span class="smcap">Ada Jane</span> catch a young
nobleman for herself, there are
plenty about.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Henry E.</span> (Walton).&#8212;How can that be? The
square of the half of any chord
of a circle is equal to the product of the sagittæ of the opposite arcs,
that is, the segments of the diameter bisecting the chord, or the versed
sines of half the opposite arcs. From this the Jews argue, and we agree
with Colonel Sibthorp in thinking they argue rightly, that no man can,
by self-measurement, get a decent fit from a tailor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">W. W.</span> and <span class="smcap">F. F.</span>&#8212;Your
 account of your ascent of Primrose Hill is very
exciting, but the feat has been performed before. To be sure, we observe
that, like some other gentlemen who just now write to the papers about
their "Ascents of Mont Blanc," you failed in reaching the top; but even
this remarkable feature in the performance scarcely entitles you to
publicity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Affectionate Emma.</span>&#8212;Your "Lines to My
Little Brother (aged 2&#190;), on
his accidentally Sitting down upon some Stinging Nettles," have point
and pensiveness, but scarcely sufficient interest for the general
reader. Still we hope your brother is better.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charley</span>, having been thrown over by a
young lady, wishes to return
everything she has ever sent him, but finds a difficulty, from the fact
that, her papa having been a pastrycook, her presents chiefly consisted
of jam tarts, Albert rock, and the like, which <span class="smcap">Charley</span>
 has eaten long
ago. The dilemma is new and delicate, but if <span class="smcap">Charley's</span>
 conscience is
tender, he had better estimate the price of the articles, and enclose it
to the old Pattypan, from whom Miss had clearly no right to take them.
But, as has been classically said, <i>Jams ate is</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bellicosus Jocosus.</span>&#8212;You may obtain a
commission in the army, by leaving
your card at Lord Hardinge's any day before four o'clock, and by calling
for an answer next day. You may give the servant one shilling. This
applies to the line only. To become a guardsman, call at the Junior
United Service Club any evening between six and nine, walk boldly into
the dining-room, and state your wish to any party who may be dining
together. The rest of the process you will find very simple.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Bride.</span>&#8212;Do not distress yourself. Very
likely he loves you sincerely,
and his winking at the bridesmaid might be mere accident&#8212;the whisper
was probably to tell her how pretty you looked&#8212;and the pressure of her
hand gratitude for her ready acknowledgment of it. Even the note may be
explained; it was the address to which she is to forward some present
for you. Never worry yourself about trifles&#8212;you have married him, and
she is cut out. Go on your tour rejoicing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeune Philosophe.</span>&#8212;Matter is, no doubt, as
you contend, an integral part
of cognate consciousness; but do not push this law to an absurdity. If
homogeneous self-antipathies come into conflict with inchoate
rationalism, where will you draw the line between casuality and
causality? Hadn't you better shut up?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anxious Jemima.</span>&#8212;There is no rule as to the
 number of clergymen
requisite at a wedding. One able-bodied clerk in orders can do all that
is necessary. The "assisting" system is a ridiculous custom, introduced
by the Puseyites, by way of assimilating the ceremony to that of Rome.
At the same time, we admit that a clergyman has a hard duty to perform
in managing <i>some</i> couples, and it is probably in these cases that
he
calls in extra hands. Look at the announcements with that idea in your
mind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sight-Seer.</span>&#8212;You may walk into Buckingham
Palace whenever you please,
and without any ticket. But when you enter the rooms in which any of the
Royal Family are sitting, you should put out your cigar, and politeness,
if not loyalty, dictates your making some complimentary remark on the
elegance of the building. If you have apples or other fruit in your
pocket, you may offer them to the younger Princes and Princesses; but we
believe there is an objection to their R. H. accepting slices of
cocoa-nut, or toffy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">William P.</span>&#8212;We think the young lady was
quite justified in slamming the
door in your face, and in throwing the geranium pots at you from the
two-pair window; indeed, we do not see how any person calling herself a
lady could have acted otherwise.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Puzzled.</span>&#8212;We have so repeatedly explained
that <i>R. S. V. P.</i>, on a note
of invitation, means "Write and Say Vether you'll be Present," that we
are tired of answering the inquiry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Theatricus</span> (Ebury Street).&#8212;We shall be
happy to read all your
thirty-four plays, and, having done so, to recommend them to such
managers as they may best suit. There will be no difficulty about money,
but we shall be happy to make any advance you may require while the
plays are in rehearsal. One hundred guineas an act is the lowest price
paid at any Metropolitan theatre.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smackarjee Woppajee</span> (Calcutta).&#8212;We are
much obliged. The sketch of the
Ayah running round the compound after the Adjutant (bird), and the
khansuma and the chuprassy pelting her with her own tabeejes and
banjoobunds, has been handed to one of our artists, but we fear the
nutcut will make but a queer jummakur of it. So you have got your
juwaub, eh? Never mind, there are other young ladies in India. Ask
again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Query.</span>&#8212;You are wrong. Sardanápalus is
accented on the middle syllable;
Zante is a dissyllable; Chobham is pronounced Cobham; theátre is
accented on the <i>a</i>; Phäeton is sounded fee-á-ton; and Mr. Disraeli
 as
Mr. De Hisreelly. Attend to these niceties if you would be supposed to
have lived in good society.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Young Housekeeper.</span>&#8212;In September pickle
garlic, parsnips, and spinach,
and pour vinegar into each of your marmalade pots, to prevent
fermentation. Smear the frames of your looking-glasses and pictures with
tar and treacle; and be careful that the pantry doors and windows are
left open at nights, as the autumn air of the garden is cold for the
cats. If you have beer in the house, drink it.</p>

<h2>SAINT CABBIE!</h2>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 30%;">
<a href="images/105a.png">
<img src="images/105a.png" alt="Cartoon-Horse smoking cigarette."
width="100%" /></a>
</div>

<p>The French have their <span class="smcap">Saint Fiacre</span>, who
must be the patron saint of
hackney coaches; why shouldn't the English calendar boast, in the like
manner, of its "<span class="smcap">Saint Cabbie</span>?" The sufferings
 of that much injured
creature have been more than sufficient lately to elevate him to the
honours of canonisation; and the weakness, the uncomplaining
resignation, with which he has borne those sufferings, surely entitle
him to some public mark of our gratitude? Has he fallen from his high
elevation of eightpence&#8212;or, rather, a shilling&#8212;down to sixpence,
fallen almost without a murmur&#8212;and is no popular testimonial to be
given him by way of ointment to that fall? Has he not endured the taunts
of vulgar minds without a retort? Has he not sat quietly under the
sarcasms of little boys, and never once used his whip to drive them
away? Has he not been hunted from stand to stand, worse than a wild
beast, by the policemen? And has he not been compelled, which was adding
insult to injury, to carry himself and cab to the station-house (without
being paid, mind you, for the additional distance,) as often as the
vindictive object was to fine him? These are broad daylight truths which
we require no turning on of the gas to recognise&#8212;these are trials and
triumphs of temper which are so many proofs of martyrdom, scarcely to be
surpassed by any you will find in "Fox's Book Of Martyrs." We propose,
therefore, that some statue be erected in honour of <span class="smcap">Saint
 Cabbie</span>; and we
think Scotland Yard, which has been the scene where he has been made to
bleed so often for his injured cause, would be the fittest spot for the
erection. Designs for the statue should be thrown open to public
competition and sent in, for selection, to the Police Commissioners. For
ourselves, we are anxious to contribute our small mite to the worthy
object, and beg, therefore, to suggest the following appropriate
design:&#8212;</p>

<p>Let a wild horse&#8212;the wildest that can be found on the Green Yard&#8212;be
harnessed to the craziest cab that can be picked off a nocturnal cab
stand, and on the top of that cab let poor Cabbie be fastened <i>à la
Mazeppa</i>. An aureol, made of dirty straw, should shine round his
head;
his whip should be lying by his side, broken in two, and suspended round
his neck should be his badge of suffering, on which should be marked the
fatal word "<b>6</b><i>d.</i>" On the box should be seated a Member of
Parliament
(the conventional long ears of an M.P. might be left out on this
occasion), with the New Cab Act in his hand, driving the poor Cabman to
desperation. The motto on the panel might be "<span class="smcap">For
Wheel and Woe</span>."</p>

<p>The above design, we are sure, would work up into a very magnificent
statue.</p>

<p>In the meantime we hope <span class="smcap">Cardinal Wiseman</span>
will exercise all his influence
with the <span class="smcap">Pope</span>, or whoever may be the great
almanac-maker; at Rome, to
have <span class="smcap">Saint Cabbie</span> introduced by the side of <span
 class="smcap">Saint Fiacre</span> in the Romish
Calendar.</p>

<hr />

<h4>A Present from the Pope.</h4>

<p>His Holiness&#8212;says the <i>Journal de Bruxelles</i>&#8212;has sent to the
young
bridegroom, the <span class="smcap">Duke of Brabant</span>, "a fragment
of the wood of the manger
which formed the cradle of our Saviour." The <span class="smcap">Pope</span>
 has a constant supply
of relics on hand to be bestowed on fitting persons and fitting
occasions. Enthrone Liberty in the Capitol, and the <span class="smcap">Pope</span>,
 no doubt,
would send <i>her</i> a relic; nothing less than "the Kiss of <span
class="smcap">Judas</span>?"</p>

<hr />

<h4>POOR SHAKSPEARE!</h4>

<p>The fiddles are once more at him. Again is <span class="smcap">Shakspeare</span>
 to be bow-strung.
<span class="smcap">Verdi</span>&#8212;we learn from the <i>Post</i>&#8212;is
putting <i>King Lear</i> and <i>Hamlet</i> to
cat gut. It is, moreover, whispered that <i>Hamlet</i> is destined for
the
Princess's; <i>Hamlet</i> to be sung by <span class="smcap">Mr. Charles
Kean</span>, who is expected to
make a great hit in the solo of "To be or not to be," in which he will
accompany himself on the Jews'-harp.</p>

<h2>REVIEW OF THE MEDICAL LINE.</h2>

<p>A grand review of the Medical Staff of the Metropolis was held
yesterday
by <span class="smcap">Surgeon-General</span> <i>Punch</i>; the officers
 and men of the various parishes
presenting themselves in professional rank and file.</p>

<p>The colours of the corps have become rather faded in consequence of
exposure to foul air and exhalations. They are red, blue, and green, in
correspondence with night-lamps and shop-window bottles; and are
emblazoned with the names of various localities in which the force,
performing services of danger, has triumphed over cholera, typhus, and
other foes; as "Fig Tree Court," "Puddle Dock," "Twister's Alley,"
"Paradise Row," "Mount Pleasant," "Slumson's Rents," "Grimes's Mews,"
&amp;c.</p>

<p>The troops went through the exercise of prescribing, compounding,
mixing, and the other evolutions of a sham fight with disease; executing
their operations with great rapidity and precision. The mortar practice
was much admired.</p>

<p>The appearance of the officers and men was better than could have
been
expected, considering the generally small amount of their pay.</p>

<h2>A SHOE-LANE RALEIGH!</h2>

<p>The <i>Morning Herald</i> has a beautiful leader upon the <span
class="smcap">Queen's</span> visit to
Dublin; a very beautiful bit of work, indeed. The <i>Herald</i> praises
with
manly devotion the name of woman, and the name of mother. <i>But</i>&#8212;</p>

<blockquote><p>"But when to both these there is added the title of our <span
 class="smcap">Queen</span>! she
may not only as in the days of <span class="smcap">Raleigh</span>, step
on our cloaks, but  our&#8212;-</p>

<p>What do you think? Guess. Breasts? No. Guess again. Hearts? Oh dear
no&#8212;</p>

<p>"but our <i>coats</i>!"</p></blockquote>

<p>If the loyalty of the <i>Herald</i> continues&#8212;regardless of
expense&#8212;to rise
in this manner, the next climax may be thus&#8212;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Not only on our coats, <i>but</i> our <span
class="smcap">WAISTCOATS</span>!"</p></blockquote>

<p>There, we trust, the loyalty of the <i>Herald</i> will, if only for

<h4>The Wrongs of Scotland.</h4>

shamefully snubbed and
slighted by sister England. There are two Dukes to be made Knights of
the Thistle: and the <i>Edinburgh Evening Post</i> very pertinently
asks, Why
should they not be created at Holyrood, on the soil whereto the thistle
is indigenous? Why not? Honest <span class="smcap">Sancho</span> says,
"Let every tub stand on its
own bottom." And in like manner, why not every Scotch knight sit on his
own Thistle?</p>

<p>Now that Parliament stands prorogued, and the game of all parties
consists of partridges and grouse, the journals naturally supply the
place of political news with wonderful shots, and other marvellous items
of sporting intelligence: as, for instance, the following paragraph
which the <i>Morning Post</i> quotes from the <i>North British Daily
Mail</i>:&#8212;</p>

<blockquote><p>"<span class="smcap">New Mode of Catching Wild Duck.</span>&#8212;A
 farmer in Bute, some time ago,
having sown his crop, set up a couple of harrows in a field to dry,
back to back, <i>i.e.</i> with the iron spikes outward. On making a
round
of his field shortly afterwards, to his astonishment he found a wild
duck spitted on one of his harrows. Whether the creature in its
flight in the dark had encountered the spike of the harrow, or been
dashed against it by a gust of wind, no one can tell; but the truth
of the story may be relied upon, as our informant, the farmer
himself, is a most respectable man, and an elder of the Church."</p></blockquote>

<p>Both respectable men and elders of the Church are capable now and
then
of indulging in a little toxophilite recreation; archery: shooting with
the old English weapon of <span class="smcap">Robin Hood</span>. The
elder sometimes comes, or
becomes, the ancient of the Church militant or old soldier, over us. The
above narrative may, perhaps, be regarded as a shaft of waggery aimed at
the bull's eye of faith. A correspondent, however, who is farther North
than even the <i>North British Daily Mail</i>, assures us that it tells
the
truth, though not the whole truth. That a bird was spitted on one of the
harrows in the manner described, is a positive fact. But the additional
circumstance should have been mentioned, that a couch-fire having been
made between the harrows, for the twofold purpose of burning the weeds,
and drying the implements the more effectually, the creature was found
not only spitted but roasted. It further remains to be stated, that the
bird which was so silly as to spit itself, or get spitted, in its
blundering flight, was not a duck, but a goose; which thus became its
own cook. Last of all the coincidence deserves to be recorded, that the
feathered simpleton, which, previously to the stupid act, had just been
feeding, probably in an adjoining garden, was discovered, with some
presentiment of its destiny, to have stuffed itself with sage and
onions.</p>

<h4>Walker!</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Women</span>&#8212;they so like matches of any sort&#8212;have taken to
walking-matches. A <span class="smcap">Mrs. Dunn</span>, of Hartshill, is walking 1,000 miles in
1,000 hours. Another lady, one <span class="smcap">Miss Mew</span>, of Cateaton Street, has also
offered to do the same distance in the same time with this additional
difficulty&#8212;she offers to walk in walnut-shells. Friends who know
her best back her at long odds.</p>

<hr />

<h4>AN AUSTRALIAN CLIPPER.</h4>

<p>Lighting accidentally on an Australian paper, we were struck by an
advertisement of a steamer for sale at Sydney, which really seems worth
attention. It professes to be so complete in every department that, if
it should happen to go to pieces, there are ample arrangements on board
for building another vessel as a substitute. There is "a double set of
machinery;" and, in fact, there appears to be everything in duplicate,
so that, if the vessel should unhappily go down, there is a counterpart
on board to supply the defect.</p>

<p>We do not quite understand the mode by which this desirable state of
things has been effected, but we have long ceased to be surprised at
anything, and should not be astonished if we were to see the
announcement of a ship with a double set of officers, and even a double
supply of passengers, so that if anything happened to either there would
be sufficient substitutes at hand. Considering that the announcement
comes from a land in which the gold mania is at its height, we cannot
wonder at the duplicity of the speculation, since double-dealing is
thought nothing remarkable where all are thinking of nothing but getting
gold.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Punch,</span>&#8212;The Chinese language will
 no doubt be added to the

advertisements are even now frightful to read. When, and how am I to
learn such words as will soon be expected of me? How am I to afford a
journey to China in order to get the right pronunciation? I am told
everything is to be taught through the medium of the Chinese: our only
chance seems to be to get the Pekin twang as fast as possible.</p>

<h4>AN ABODE OF BLISS.</h4>

<p>We wish we were on visiting terms with the family, the heads of which
have put into a Manchester contemporary the subjoined advertisement:&#8212;</p>

<blockquote><p>TO PARENTS AND GUARDIANS.&#8212;WANTED, in a family, a
respectable YOUNG
PERSON, as Seamstress and Upper Nurse, and to make herself useful.
It is expected that a comfortable home, and the opportunity of
improvement, will be considered equivalent to her services for the
first twelve months.&#8212;Address, M., 27, at the Printers'.</p></blockquote>

<p>Were we in the habit of friendly intercourse with these nice people,
they would sometimes&#8212;often, we should hope&#8212;ask us to dinner. And what
a dinner it would be! Moreover, if we stopped to sleep, what luxurious
accommodation would be provided for us in a house where the comforts of
home are considered equivalent to the services of a Seamstress or Upper
Nurse! O the turtle! O the venison! O the superior descriptions of
French and Rhine wine! O the profundity of bliss in sinking to slumber
in an abyss of down! But O the victuals! O the dinner!&#8212;in the first
place&#8212;if dinner can be depended upon in an establishment wherein the
cook most likely gets no wages.</p>

<p>One <span class="smcap">J. J. Daw</span>&#8212;alias, we presume, <span

Guildhall to profess himself a convert to the Jewish faith. "He is not
insane," says the medical authority; "but is a vegetarian." The truth
is, the cause of the poor man's conversion is simply this: he has lived
upon roots only, and they have got into his head and taking great
interest there, have become Hebrew ones.</p>

<p class="cap_3">THE Chinese Revolution progresses in a peculiar manner.
 Heads are not
falling, as was the case in France, but tails are with marvellous
rapidity in this Celestial Reign of Terror, the <span class="smcap">Robespierres</span>
 of which
are sending mandarins by thousands to the scaffold, to be deprived of
those appendages. The execution of one of these dignitaries took place
yesterday, in conformity with the following sentence:&#8212;</p>
</div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Ding Dong</span>, Brother of the Moon, and Chief
 Justice to the Planets,
having sat in judgment with great patience for the greater part of an
hour upon <span class="smcap">Ku Long</span>, accused of
narrow-mindedness and villainous
detestable obstinacy, in adhering pertinaciously to obsolete usages and
fashions, considers the said charge against the prisoner fully
established, and hereby pronounces him to stand convicted of rascality,
perversity, and pig-tailed obstructiveness, which are evil principles,
proceeding from the suggestions of demons and imps; seeing that these
bad dispositions form the source whence the pigtail springs, and whereby
that horrible and ugly excrescence is nourished, it would be desirable
to eradicate them, in order that the absurd and ludicrous tail might
fall off in consequence. But as there are some objects which are not
possible, in the nature of things, and this is one of them, it is best
not to attempt to do what would prove impracticable; and therefore the
case requires the decree to be different.</p>

<p>For which reason, the sentence upon <span class="smcap">Ku Long</span>
 is declared to be that he
shall, with as much expedition as the necessary preparations admit of,
be conducted by the officers of justice to a scaffold, and having been
placed thereon in a convenient chair, shall have his pigtail severed
from his head, both as a punishment to himself, and a warning to others,
to intimidate and deter them from making hogs of themselves by wearing
tails, like those of swine, but not in the manner the pig wears his tail
in, but the reverse&#8212;which makes it more preposterous. Respect this; and
chop <span class="smcap">Ku Long's</span> tail off as soon as you can."</p>

<h2>EVIL EYESIGHT.</h2>

<p>Some of our contemporaries appear to be labouring under a political
jaundice, by which distemper they are caused to see everything through a
blue or buff medium. The <i>Standard</i> supplies a case in point, out
of the
<i>Yorkshire Gazette</i>; in the subjoined portion of an account of some
local festivities:&#8212;</p>

<blockquote><p>... "Before late in the day not less than 1500 had
congregated
together, and were engaged in all kinds of sports and games, and
many were the waltzes and polkas, &amp;c., which were gracefully
performed by the lovers of the dance. <span class="smcap">The Earl and
Countess of
Mulgrave</span>, with their children and the <span class="smcap">Honourable
 E. Phipps</span>, the
rejected candidate of Whitby, joined the party.</p>

<p>"We would advise our Conservative friends to watch the influence
acquired by this new mode of treating."</p></blockquote>

<p>This is the way in which one party looks at another, that other being
 a
simple merrymaking! Motley is the only wear for a writer whose ideas are
so party-coloured. Cannot the superior classes cultivate kindly feelings
with their neighbours without being accused of inferior motives? Such
mean imputations ought not to emanate from the forces who march under
the banner of <span class="smcap">Colonel Sibthorp</span>, but with whom
 the Member for Lincoln
will be ashamed to march through Coventry, or at least, through thick
and thin of this kind. The <span class="smcap">Colonel</span>, who
insists on the right of treating
his constituents jovially, would repudiate with scorn the charge of
corruption, brought against him for dancing amongst them around a
Maypole; he would be highly indignant at being suspected of trying to
turn voters round by spinning their daughters in a waltz; of insidious
designs in tripping down the middle and up again, and, in doing hands
across, of an underhand man&oelig;uvre: he would be disgusted to find
himself thought capable of any trick below the double shuffle.</p>

<p>The "new mode of treating" might, indeed, be advantageously "watched
by
our Conservative friends"&#8212;and imitated. To treat the people, by mixing
with them in courteous intercourse, would be wise of the aristocracy.
But sorrily will the great folks be encouraged to relax their
exclusiveness, either socially, or as proprietors of parks and picture
galleries, by representing them as doing so merely in a spirit of
baseness.</p>

<h2>GREAT CURE AND SMALL PAY.</h2>

<p>Did you ever hear of a clerical <span class="smcap">Sergeant Kite</span>?
 Here you have apparently
that non-commissioned officer&#8212;no offence to the probably Tractarian
author of the advertisement following, taken from that highly religious
paper, <i>The Guardian</i>:&#8212;</p>

<blockquote><p>CURATE WANTED, for a small country village in the diocese
 of
Lichfield. Incumbent resident; daily prayers; weekly Communion; day,
night, and Sunday schools; plenty of work of all kinds. Salary £90,
with a house and garden. The Curate must be a sound Churchman, with
his heart in his work, and willing to obey orders. He must have good
health, be able to conduct a choral service, and to preach (if
necessary) three or four times a week. Direct P., under cover to <span
class="smcap">Mr.
Masters</span>, 33, Aldersgate Street, London.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is a roll on the modern drum ecclesiastic&#8212;<span class="smcap">Sergeant
 Kite</span> beating up
for recruits in the noble army of martyrs. For the services above
enumerated, many and arduous as they are, appear to be services of
danger, rather. The heart which the Curate is expected to have in the
work would be soon worn out in it. It is to be feared that the good
health he is required to enjoy would not endure very long. In an
extremely brief space of time he would pray, preach, teach, and chant
himself to death. At least the sound Churchman would speedily get out of
condition; grow as phthisical and hectic as any hero of a "religious"
novel. With a salary of £90 a year, it may be anticipated that he would
go fast to the dogs, and make such an end as a Curate might have made
under <span class="smcap">Nero</span>.</p>

<p>The Incumbent, however, in want of a Curate, may perhaps be also in
want
of bread, or so poorly off in that respect, as to be unable to offer the
assistant for whom he advertises more than a share of his crust. But
then he ought to have mentioned this circumstance, that broken meat
might have been sent to him, and that steps might have been taken to
enable him to participate in the bounty of the Society for Supplying
Clergymen with Old Clothes.</p>

<h2>THE CHELSEA GHOST.</h2>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/108.png" alt="W" class="cap" width="30%" />

<p class="cap_3">WITHIN the sound of the pleasant bells of St. Barnabas,
 and within
stone's throw of&#8212;<i>Punch</i> does not know how many&#8212;churches, chapels,
literary and scientific lecture-rooms, schools, and other institutions,
mainly intended for the exorcising of ignorance, a Ghost has just dared
to show itself, and hundreds of fools have attended its levee.</p>
</div>

<p>Pond Street is the locality&#8212;the name is suggestive of stagnation and
greenness&#8212;and here has been seen a terrible apparition, "A Tall Man
with a Deathlike Face and Snowy Garments Reaching to his Feet." Allowing
for the poetry which broke out in snow, the description serves
wonderfully for an Irish labourer who, having been desperately beaten in
one of the religious ceremonies of his nation, gets out of bed in the
night-gown lent him by the hospital. But we will believe the Ghost to be
veritable, and to have a mission. Let us see what it is.</p>

<p>First, a sturdy young "excavator" goes up-stairs into the ghostly
chamber, and being in his cups, is the easier victim to the saucer eyes,
which flame on him so hideously that he falls down in a fit.</p>

<p>Secondly, another "excavator" (if these poor spade men have been
disturbing the Ghost's earthly tenement in its grave, justice would have
sent the remonstrating spectre to the surveyor's office, or the
contractor's counting-house) goes up-stairs, only to fall down in a fit
like his predecessor.</p>

<p>Thirdly, an older labourer comes home, and being informed of the
affair,
proceeds to enquire into it. Stricken down in horror, his fits last for
hours.</p>

<p>The neighbourhood, now clustered in agitation round the haunted
house,
clamours for the Police. Three gallant and well-grown officers,
uniformed, and belted, and braceleted, and bludgeoned, march fearlessly
into the house, prepared to say "Come, cut it," or "Be off out of that,"
to the grimmest phantom on the walk. In a few minutes the lettered
heroes rush out of the dwelling, their horror untold; but a policeman,
paid a guinea a week (less deductions), must have seen something
remarkable when he declares, that "untold gold" should not induce him to
stay in the place. And these legal authorities actually counsel the
householders to leave the dreadful house as soon as possible.</p>

<p>The mission, you see, for which a supernatural visitor is sent from
the
world of spirits, prospers. Three labourers go into fits, and three
policemen are frightened out of their duty. Then doors bang all night,
and groans are heard, and a mob blocks up the street until five in the
morning. And <i>Mr. Punch</i>, who, as may often be seen in the streets,
 is
ready to tackle any ghost with that unhesitating club of his, goes the
next afternoon to Pond Street, and finds the assembly again in full
force, but not very reverent, and discussing the ghost's nature with
that freedom of epithet characteristic of street conversationists. <i>Mr.
Punch</i> was very much shocked to hear the roar of laughter which
greeted
a proposition, made by a gentleman in his shirt-sleeves and with a short
pipe, to the effect that if any one would "stand" (<i>Mr. Punch</i>
believes
he reports the right word) a vessel of malt liquor, he would go into the
house (which appears to have resembled that of <span class="smcap">Saul</span>),
 and inflict upon
the Ghost&#8212;as to whose future destiny the speaker's expressions showed
that he had made up his mind&#8212;a species of castigation which certainly
should be reserved for extreme cases. And <i>Mr. Punch</i> further
reports
that all along the King's Road, and near the Hospital, and even towards
theatrical Brompton, many of whose inhabitants have rejoiced to see "the
Ghost walk," the popular invitation was "Come on; let's go and see that
blessed Ghost." Clearly, therefore, the supernatural visitor is
fulfilling the important mission for which only can we suppose he has
been sent from another world.</p>

<p>When the clergy of the neighbourhood heard of the affair, they were
greatly moved. One of them, a young Barnabasian, threw down the sweetest
handful of charming artificial flowers, with which he was making an
altar-wreath for Sunday, rushed into the crowd, and affectionately, but
earnestly, reproved his humbler brethren for putting faith in such
vulgar and impious folly. He entered the haunted house, walked all over
it, and throwing up every window in turn, addressed a few words of
gentle ridicule from each: and he ended by leading away the whole
assembly to his church, where he gave them some sound, shrewd counsel,
which will probably spoil a Ghost's market in that quarter for some
time. Others of the clergy, roused by the spectacle in Pond Street, have
been equally active; and perhaps after all, this was the Ghost's real
mission. In this case "it is an honest ghost, that let <i>Punch</i> tell
 ye."</p>

<p>The Roman Catholic priests of the vicinity, however, look at the
matter
in another light, and regard the "Deathlike face" as the editor of the
<i>Tablet</i> does the Salette miracle, where the Virgin astonished the
weak
mind of the pig-boy and girl, and sent a very proper message to the
French people not to swear. They say that the Ghost is that of somebody
who, not having paid up the priest's "dues," will haunt the
neighbourhood until somebody else pays them for him. The landlord of the
house, who seems to have most reason to complain of the apparition,
intends to pay these "dues," and charge them in the rent, unless the
next tenant likes to take the Ghost with the fixtures.</p>

<p>This is, <i>Punch</i> joyfully admits, an enlightened age, but its
lights
will, sometimes, burn blue.</p>

<h2>LOUIS NAPOLEON AT BOULOGNE.</h2>

<p>It is said that "the authorities" are making extensive preparations
for
the reception of <span class="smcap">Louis Napoleon</span> at Boulogne.
As this is not his first
visit, and as it is usual on occasions of great public ceremonials, to
refer to "precedents," we may expect to find the "authorities" searching
their annals in order to discover how <span class="smcap">Louis Napoleon</span>
 was formerly
received. It is not necessary to go very far back in making the inquiry,
as it is as recent as 1840 that <span class="smcap">Louis Napoleon</span>
 was "received" by the
authorities of the place. On that occasion he was met by the National
Guard, who, with great valour, fired a salute of loaded muskets on the
present Emperor and his handful of almost defenceless friends. No other
carriage being in readiness, a bathing-machine was provided for the
reception of the Prince, who was conveyed, amid a detachment of
soldiers, to the prison in the upper town. The Imperial eagle, instead
of being displayed on banners, was present in person, and was removed by
the "authorities" to the <i>abattoir</i>.</p>

<p>Having reached this result of an inquiry into precedents, we wait
patiently for the official programme of the <i>fêtes</i> which will take
place in honour of the Emperor's visit to Boulogne. It is quite clear
from the events of the last four years that the watering place alluded
to was, in 1840, wholly unacquainted with the real sentiments of the
French nation. We must suppose that, in 1853, it comes much nearer the
mark.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ensign Harrison</span>, who has just received his
 commission in the "Bucks
Invincibles," promoted, during his stay at Baden-Baden, to the Captaincy
of a crack regiment in <span class="smcap">Her Majesty's</span> line.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Sutherland</span>, the stock-broker's wife,
of Dalston, who is at present
stopping at Ems with her seven unmarried daughters, promoted by the
landlord and waiters of the Hotel, where she is stopping, into <span
class="smcap">Lady
Sutherland</span>, and the promotion gazetted accordingly in all the <i>Journaux</i>
and <i>Zeitungen</i> of the place. N.B. The promotion is not in the
least
denied by <span class="smcap">Mrs. Sutherland</span>, until she is
presented with 'the small
amount' of Her Ladyship's bill, when she is very indignant "at the idea
of being taken for a Lady."</p>

<p>There are several other promotions that generally take place during
the
Autumn by persons who are travelling. Shopmen aspire to the rank of
gentlemen; young gentlemen give themselves the air and pretensions of
noblemen; and ladies do not mind to what high rank they may be promoted,
knowing well enough they must sink down again to the plain Mrs., the
moment they return to Baker Street. But it is otherwise with the
gentlemen, who, it is notorious, are more easily led away by the
vanities of this world than the ladies; thus, you will meet with swarms
of <i>Rentiers</i> in the shape of young gentlemen who have scarcely got
sufficient to pay the expenses of their journey home; with innumerable
<i>Hommes de Lettres</i>, who have never had anything to do with them,
beyond
writing a letter occasionally, signed "A Father of a Family," or "A
Constant Reader," to the Editor of the <i>Times</i>; with railways-full
of
<i>artistes</i>, who, if the truth were known, are only hair-cutters, or
 else
the drawing-masters of some suburban girl's-school; and with no small
quantity of <i>Banquiers</i>, whom, if you could see them only in their
counting-houses at home, you would find, probably, behind the
trellis-work of a suspicious Betting-Shop, or else secreted in a dark
back-parlour, with some six other <i>Banquiers</i>, at the head of a
"Mutual
Loan and Investment Office"&#8212;for the benefit, of course, of the "Poor
Man" and not at all of themselves.</p>

<p>Beware, especially at the sea-side, and on your travels, of all <span
 class="smcap">Autumnal
Promotions</span>.</p>

<h2>THE ENGLISH HIPPOPOTAMUS, AT THE ZOOLOGICAL GARDENS, <small>TO THE</small>
 FRENCH
DITTO, AT THE "JARDIN DES PLANTES."</h2>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Mon cher Hip.</span>,&#8212;I have been reading the
account of your glorious
reception at Paris. Don't you allow your simple head to be turned by the
homage you have been receiving. Look at me, and profit by the ridiculous
lesson.</p>

<p>"But a short time ago I was as great a favourite as you now are. I
was
run after worse than a Nepaulese Ambassador&#8212;though what little lustre
there was about me was all my own&#8212;not a single diamond shone in my
ears! and my nose (at present so snubbed) was unconscious of the
smallest precious stone! No valuable Cachemire was coiled round my head,
that, in a moment of admiration, I could unroll and lay at the feet of
my fair worshippers. What little merit I possessed consisted in my
native ugliness; and though I flatter myself I am as ugly now as I was
then, still no one runs after me now.</p>

<p>"As it was with me so it will be with you. My word for it, your nose
will be similarly put out of joint by <span class="smcap">M. Dupin</span>,
 or some other
monstrosity. I was the rage, the fashionable lion of the day. Thousands
of ladies tore their dresses, and fought with their parasols, to get a
passing peep at me. They called me 'dear,' 'duck,' 'pet,' and other fond
terms of female endearment; and much they care about me at present!
Casts were made of me in sponge-cake, and adorned the pastrycooks'
windows. You saw my portrait in the frontispiece of every polka. No
periodical was complete without my biography, whilst my bulky
proportions were multiplied in a thousand different shapes, either in
snuff-boxes, ink-stands, salt-cellars, butter-boats, or else figured on
ladies' brooches. And where, I ask, am I now? I hide myself in the mud
of my bath, with shame and indignation, when I think of the base
ingratitude of the public.</p>

<p>"I cannot believe you are any uglier than I was. I will not pay you
so
egregious a compliment. I will say you possess the same bountiful share
of recommendations. In that case I beseech you, <i>mon cher</i> animal,
not
to allow your brain to be affected by the popular incense that at
present is being burnt under your admired nostrils. It is ever the
fickle taste of Fashion to forget to-morrow the idols it is worshipping
to-day. Believe me, and I speak as one who is both a hippopotamus and a
brother, you will be as little run after, as little cared about this
time next year, as I now am. At present you are <i>un charmant
hippopotame</i>, the <i>fêted</i> curiosity of the moment; wait another
twelvemonth, and they will say of you, as they do of me, that you are
nothing better than a great pig, or, worse still, they will call you
probably, in their insulting vernacular, '<i>un gros cochon</i>'.
Ponder, be
wise, and don't grow too conceited.</p>

<p>"Such is the affectionate advice of</p>

<p class="regards">"<i>Mon cher Hip</i>, your old <i>camarade du Nil</i>,</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">The Hippopotamus</span> (<i>of the
 Zoological Gardens</i>).</p>

<p>"P.S. Will you believe it, the fashionable world is now running,
'like
mad,' after two little monkeys they call <i>Aztecs</i>? The ladies
actually
kiss them! It makes one sick merely to think of it."</p>

<h4>Fearful Accident to a Great Civic Authority.</h4>

<p>The <i>Times</i>, in describing the late accident on the Great
Northern
Railway, assures us, first, that the <span class="smcap">Lord Mayor</span>
 escaped with a trifling
injury, but on the next day informs us that his Lordship continues "to
swallow with difficulty." As his Lordship was on his way to the Cutlers'
Feast, and as his Lordship's tenure of office ceases on the 9th
November, <i>Punch</i> does not see how the <i>Times</i> can reconcile
its first
with its second statement.</p>

<p class="cap_2">Since each <i>gobe-mouche</i> is speaking of Nanking or

<p class="i0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as each critic, wit, or professional diner,</p>
<p class="i0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Explains that you can't choose but see that the Mantchews</p>
<p class="i0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must soon be entirely driven from China,</p>
<p class="i0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that a high price on our Pekoe and Hyson</p>
<p class="i0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must be the infallible end of the clatter,</p>

<p class="i0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Determines to go and see what is the matter,</p>
<p class="i0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It boots not to say <i>how</i> he goes; for to-day</p>
<p class="i0">Young and old, grave and gay, so affect locomotion,</p>
<p class="i0">That the press every hour produces a shower,</p>
<p class="i0">Of "Rough Notes of a Slide on the Great Frozen Ocean,"</p>
<p class="i0">Or "A Midsummer's Ramble from Stamford to Stambol;"</p>
<p class="i0">Or "The Steppes of the Cossacks, by one who has walked in 'em;"</p>
<p class="i0">And I'm sure that whate'er <i>Mr. Punch's</i> plans were,</p>
<p class="i0">If <i>these</i> tourists could prosper, <i>he</i> wouldn't
 be baulked in 'em.</p>
<p class="i0">Like the witches, perchance, he might choose to advance,</p>
<p class="i0">And so order his coachman to bring out his brougham;</p>
<p class="i0">Or ask Ph&oelig;bus to lead forth that spirited steed,</p>
<p class="i0">Which is furnished, in turn, by each Muse, with a groom;</p>
<p class="i0">But, however, we'll fancy him safely in Quansi,</p>
<p class="i0">Or Quantong, where, taking his place 'mid the great, he,</p>
<p class="i0">Like any philandering son of a mandarin,</p>
<p class="i0">Sits enjoying his opium <i>cum dignitate</i>.</p>
<p class="i0">Rich and stately pagodas he finds on the road, as</p>
<p class="i0">He goes through the land, for the most part erected,</p>
<p class="i0">When the smallest house-tax on Gaul, Briton, or Saxon,</p>
<p class="i0">Would have stood not the least chance of being collected.</p>
<p class="i0">Wide canals, dykes, and sluices he sees, too, whose uses</p>
<p class="i0">Were applied both to traffic, to drainage, and tillage,</p>
<p class="i0">When a hard rain had undone both Paris and London,</p>
<p class="i0">To the mud they were made of restoring each village.</p>
<p class="i0">And they show him the pages of China's first sages,</p>
<p class="i0">Which were printed for sale in the towns of the Tartar;</p>
<p class="i0">When, with us, scarce a spark of wit gleamed in one clerk,</p>
<p class="i0">And <span class="smcap">De Montfort</span> "his mark" set
to our Magna Charta.</p>
<p class="i0">They declare, too, that banking quite flourished in
Nanking,</p>
<p class="i0">And that printed bank-notes were in vogue at the hour</p>
<p class="i0">When our yeomen and reeves exchanged bannocks for beeves,</p>
<p class="i0">And seldom bought less than a sheep'sworth of flour.</p>
<p class="i0">And he learns their silk factories furnished phylacteries,</p>
<p class="i0">Robes, handkerchiefs, tapestry too, in the jolly days</p>
<p class="i0">When our sires wore a quaint but light coat of blue paint,</p>
<p class="i0">With a few streaks of red upon high days and holidays;</p>
<p class="i0">And that long, long 'ere <span class="smcap">Bacon</span>
and <span class="smcap">Bungay</span> were taken</p>
<p class="i0">Unawares by the sudden blow up of their crucible,</p>
<p class="i0">Each Chinese fire-eater had found "vile saltpetre"</p>
<p class="i0">To the purpose of killing "tall fellows" reducible.</p>
<p class="i0">Then the more he enquires concerning their sires,</p>
<p class="i0">The greater the reason he sees to anticipate</p>
<p class="i0">That much of the mystery shrouding the history</p>
<p class="i0">Of Europe, the records of China will dissipate;</p>
<p class="i0">For as old <span class="smcap">Hoang Ti</span> built the
wall, strong and high,</p>
<p class="i0">To check the fierce Huns as it now checks the Tartars,</p>
<p class="i0">Not long after old <span class="smcap">Hannibal</span>
conquered at Cannæ,</p>
<p class="i0">And then wasted his time in his snug winter quarters;</p>
<p class="i0">And as if China's sons had not driven those Huns</p>
<p class="i0">Into Europe by many a subsequent battle, a</p>
<p class="i0">Longer respite, I ween, for old Rome there had been,</p>
<p class="i0">Nor Europe so early had bowed to an <span class="smcap">Attila</span>.</p>
<p class="i0">It is clear that a stranger and far greater danger</p>
<p class="i0">Threatened Rome when on Carthage her wrath she was
wreaking;</p>
<p class="i0">And that Cato the Censor had shown greater sense, or</p>
<p class="i0">Discernment, by crying "<i>Delenda est</i> Peking!"</p>
<p class="i0">But alas! all these stories of China's old glories,</p>
<p class="i0"><i>Mr. Punch</i> plainly sees it is vain to recall,</p>
<p class="i0">Since the course of the nation in civilisation</p>
<p class="i0">Has for ages been typified best by its wall.</p>
<p class="i0">No more, like his sires, the Chinese aspires</p>
<p class="i0">In science and art to be making some new step;</p>
<p class="i0">But the national skill, like a soldier on drill,</p>
<p class="i0">Keeps performing a kind of perpetual goose-step.</p>
<p class="i0">For the vast population, the <i>hand</i> cultivation</p>
<p class="i0">Of the still fertile country no longer suffices;</p>
<p class="i0">Though to drain swamps they toil, and to carry up soil</p>
<p class="i0">To the rocky hill sides, no unfrequent device is.</p>
<p class="i0">And, on seeing their dainties, poor <i>Punch</i> fit to
faint is,</p>
<p class="i0">As he cries, "Nought but famine gives such things a
price!"</p>
<p class="i0">"Rats and mice, and such <i>small</i> deer," snakes and
puppies are all dear.</p>
<p class="i0">As helping to eke out their pittance of rice.</p>
<p class="i0">Now whilst thus his quick wit is on their antiquities</p>
<p class="i0">Busy as that of a <span class="smcap">Layard</span> or <span
 class="smcap">Bonomi</span>;</p>
<p class="i0">Or, like that of <span class="smcap">M'Culloch</span>, of
pig, sheep, and bullock,</p>
<p class="i0">Rice and tea, is discussing the social economy,</p>
<p class="i0">There springs up a great riot near, and the patriot</p>
<p class="i0">Army comes marching along in its pride;</p>
<p class="i0">Crying out as they go, "We are hostile to Fô!"</p>
<p class="i0">They fling down the josses on every side,</p>
<p class="i0">And smash, in their scrimmages, all Buddha's images,</p>
<p class="i0">Whilst a new-fangled creed by their chiefs is propounded,</p>
<p class="i0">Which they call Christianity; though, when <i>Punch</i>
comes to scan it, he</p>
<p class="i0">Finds it is but <span class="smcap">Confucius</span> his
creed "worse confounded."</p>
<p class="i0">Now in hamlet or city, all quarter or pity</p>
<p class="i0">To their long hated rulers the natives refuse;</p>
<p class="i0">"Peacock's plumes" and "Red buttons" are nought but lost
muttons.</p>
<p class="i0">Whilst impatient his badges of serfdom to lose,</p>
<p class="i0">Each Chinese without fail parts his head from his tail,</p>
<p class="i0">And henceforth minds his <i>toupées</i> instead of his <i>queues</i>.</p>
<p class="i0"><i>Mr. Punch</i>&#8212;whilst applauding their courage, and
lauding</p>
<p class="i0">Their natural wish to recover their freedom&#8212;</p>
<p class="i0">Still thinks that society may with propriety</p>
<p class="i0">Expect him a brief "screed o' doctrine" to read 'em.</p>
<p class="i0">So he summons their leader, and says, "You indeed err,</p>
<p class="i0">If you think that this triumph your labour will terminate;</p>
<p class="i0">When the Mantchews have vanished, there still must be
banished</p>
<p class="i0">Many faults which for ages you've suffered to germinate.</p>
<p class="i0">Your own gross inhumanity, cunning, and vanity,</p>
<p class="i0">Which still are so great that I cannot ignore 'em,</p>
<p class="i0">Helped the Mantchews, who knew you right well, to subdue
you,</p>
<p class="i0">As the Mongols and Khalkas had oft done before 'em.</p>
<p class="i0">You have broken your chains of to-day with small pains;</p>
<p class="i0">But hereafter, if courage and honesty you lack, you</p>
<p class="i0">Will be conquered once more&#8212;like your fathers of yore,</p>
<p class="i0">By the might of some yet to come <span class="smcap">Kublai</span>
 or <span class="smcap">Hulakhu</span>;</p>
<p class="i0">For the hordes of the North are still ripe to burst forth.</p>
<p class="i0">As oft in their tents the rude minstrel or rhymer</p>
<p class="i0">Tunes his harp in the praise of those glorious days,</p>
<p class="i0">When their sires fought bravely for <span class="smcap">Gengis</span>
 or <span class="smcap">Timur</span>.</p>
<p class="i0">To conclude. If you'd thrive, you must earnestly strive</p>
<p class="i0">To rub out of men's minds the stern dictum of <span
class="smcap">Tennyson</span>,</p>
<p class="i0">That 'in Europe one day beats a year in Cathay,'</p>
<p class="i0">And thereto <i>Punch</i> heartily gives you his benison."</p>

<h2>HINT TO RAILWAY ROGUES.</h2>

<p>There is a certain arrangement which Railway Directors would do well
to
adopt in the construction of their time-tables. It is one very generally
prevalent among that class of tradesmen whom Railway Companies, for the
most part, resemble, generally, in their manner of doing business,
considered with reference to fairness and honesty. At present, the hours
of arrival and departure are given in the tables&#8212;together with a simple
disclaimer of the obligation to keep them. This is like giving an
I.O.U., under protest of non-liability for the amount; a coarse and
clumsy mode of shirking responsibility, and, what is worse, an
ineffectual one, being impracticable in law. A far preferable device
would be that of printing the hours in large letters with the
qualification of "somewhere about" prefixed in very small. By this
expedient the appearance of contradicting an engagement would be
presented without the reality, and the comfort of security would attend
the advantage of swindling.</p>

<h4>Rival Reaping-Machines.</h4>

<p>We hear a great deal about the merits of some rival reaping-machines,
but we know of nothing that can equal in the force of rivalry those
wonderful reaping-machines&#8212;a barrister's tongue, and a physician's
finger and thumb; which are the means used by both in reaping their
tremendous harvests.</p>

<h4>AN IMPERIAL SWEEP.</h4>

put the "Turk's Head" in his hands.</p>

<h2>QUEEN CHRISTINA IN ENGLAND.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Queen Dowager Christina</span>&#8212;who has brightened
 our darkened land with the
lustre of her presence&#8212;is sedulously studying all our London
institutions, in order to do her best to take back and naturalise copies
thereof in Spain. She has already visited the Bank of England, and
exhibited the most interesting astonishment on learning that the
dividends were regularly paid to the public creditor. At first she
received the intelligence laughingly, as a bit of heavy <i>badinage</i>,
 the
best joke that the dull English could get up for her. However, the
Governor of the Bank of England, having gravely assured <span
class="smcap">Her Majesty</span> that
the Bank regularly paid the public creditor&#8212;he moreover produced the
books in testimony of the pleasing fact&#8212;<span class="smcap">Christina</span>,
 as an ex-queen and a
lady, with a frank smile and a graceful curtsey, avowed her belief in
the singular custom.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Christina</span>, though still handsome and by no
 means old, is nevertheless
addicted to serious meditation. It is said that, in token of her
contempt of all worldly fopperies, she has worked more than one flag for
fast-sailing vessels, trading to the coast of Africa, and
landing&#8212;(<span class="smcap">Lucifer</span> willing and able)&#8212;their
black merchandise at the
Havannah. The flag has at once been typical of the profits of trade, and
the final nothingness of all commercial things; <i>i. e.</i>&#8212;a Death's
Head
and Cross-Bones embroidered in white silk upon black satin; and duly
blessed by <span class="smcap">Her Majesty's</span> confessor. It is
said that <span class="smcap">Her Majesty</span>, in
admiration of <i>Uncle Tom</i>, offered a very handsome testimonial to <span
 class="smcap">Mrs.
Beecher Stowe</span>; namely, a little black boy, wonderfully
accomplished, as
page. This story, however, wants confirmation.</p>

<p>We keep the most interesting intelligence for the last. <span
class="smcap">Her Majesty</span> has
paid a visit to the cemeteries of Norwood, Kensal Green, and Highgate;
and&#8212;she is an excellent artist&#8212;was so much pleased with the last, that
she made a sketch of the burial-grounds with her own royal hand, and
sent it off by express to Madrid, accompanied by an autograph letter to
her queenly daughter, recommending the sketch to be followed (with all
allowance for limited space) in the new cemetery (<i>when</i> granted)
to the
Protestant English.</p>

<h2>COTTON AFLOAT.</h2>

<p>The Americans have made another magnificent discovery of the use of
cotton. Cotton makes the best cordage for ships. It runs freer, and ties
tighter knots. (The knots hitherto caused by cotton all <i>Uncle Tom's</i>
can bear witness to.) Cotton, moreover, makes the best sails: for the
<i>Sovereign of the Seas</i>, Yankee craft, has sails as well as rigging
 of
the fabric. What a slave-clipper might be rigged by the appropriate
cotton! What a thing of life (and death) to walk the middle-passage; to
fly in and out of African bays and creeks! But one ceremony would be
needed to make such a craft perfect. She ought to be christened by the
<span class="smcap">Queen Dowager of Spain</span>. As <span
class="smcap">Her Majesty</span> is about the richest slaveholder,
the very largest dealer in human flesh, it would be very appropriate
that she should give a name to the kidnapping craft. We would suggest as
a name <i>The Christina</i>. The slaver rigged with cotton, and the
Dowager
Queen rigged with the spoils of slavery, would be worthy of one another.</p>

<p>In the above announcement should be made the following
corrections:&#8212;For
"Shooting, Sporting, &amp;c.," read "Preaching, Praying, &amp;c.;" for
"Manor,"
read "Parish;" for "Persons," read "Parsons;" for "County of Lincoln,"
read "Diocess of Lincoln," &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>For "All Poachers, &amp;c., will be proceeded against with the utmost
 rigour
of the law," read "All Preachers will be proceeded against with the
utmost rigour of the Gospel"&#8212;by "Poachers," understanding to be meant
unauthorised fanatics and disseminators of false doctrine. Understand,
also, that the hope expressed by <span class="smcap">Mr. Tollemache</span>,
 "that all qualified
Parsons will refrain from trespassing," &amp;c., means that he does not
wish
other clergymen to interfere with his people. Lastly, for "Conviction,"
read "Conversion;" for "for," "from;" and for "Game," "Divine." This is
a quaint way of expressing himself on the part of the <span
class="smcap">Reverend Ralph
William Lionel Tollemache</span>; but <span class="smcap">John Bunyan</span>
 was quaint; so was <span class="smcap">John
Wesley</span>: so was <span class="smcap">Rowland Hill</span>&#8212;why not <span
 class="smcap">Mr. Tollemache</span>?</p>

<p>It is too bad to represent a Minister as addicted to the sports of
the
Field, when, in fact, he devotes himself to the labours of the Vineyard;
as beating stubble and cover with retrievers of the canine species,
instead of perambulating the highways and by-ways with Scripture
Readers; and in place of converting criminals to rectitude, as
converting poachers into criminals.</p>

<p>The spiritual manor of the <span class="smcap">Reverend Mr.
Tollemache</span> includes several
districts; but, anxious as he is to do the work of them himself, it is
not fair to call him a pluralist. His mild wish that his brethren will
refrain from trespassing on his ground, assures us that he has no
difficulty in forgiving all his neighbours their trespasses.</p>

<h2>THE DISAPPOINTED DIRECTOR.</h2>

<center>(A FABLE.)</center>

<p>An eminent Railway Director, having early business of importance,
ordered himself to be called at 6. He was not roused till 6.35. His
footman said he was very sorry; he had overslept himself. But he
protested he had made every effort to insure his getting up soon enough.</p>

<p>The Railway Director rang for his hot water. It was lukewarm. The
kettle
had not been got to boil. However, the housemaid vowed she had made
every effort to insure its boiling.</p>

<p>The Director of Railways sat down to breakfast. He had to wait five
minutes for his egg: and then it was but half done. The egg had not been
thought of till just that moment, and then had to be sent out for.
Nevertheless the cook had, she declared, made every effort to insure
breakfast betimes.</p>

<p>Having swallowed his coffee, which was filthy, notwithstanding that
the
servant had made every effort to insure its goodness, and devoured his
heavy roll, to insure whose lightness every effort had been made by the
baker; the Railway Director called for his boots, which did not shine,
although every effort had been made to polish them. He then took a cab,
and arrived at his destination about a quarter of an hour later than the
time that should have been occupied by the journey; still, the driver
averred stoutly that he had made every effort to get his horse to go.</p>

<p>A large party of friends and colleagues, including several
capitalists,
most of whom were great epicures and gluttons, and also dyspeptic and
gouty subjects, whose stomachs and tempers were alike impatient, had
assembled at the house of the Railway Director to dine at 7.30. The
dinner was not announced till 8.15, albeit Messrs. <span class="smcap">Bubb</span>
 and <span class="smcap">Grubb</span>, with
all the resources of <span class="smcap">Magog's</span> Coffee-House at
command, had made every
effort to insure punctuality.</p>

<p>Hereupon the Railway Director, losing control over his feelings,
indignantly demanded what was the meaning of all this? adding, with an
oath, that he supposed the world to be in a conspiracy against him. To
which one of his guests, a little punchy man, who was wiser than the
rest, replied, "You are quite right; but the reason why the world has
conspired against you is, because you and your association conspire
against the world to deceive and defraud it; for you fix certain hours
in your time-tables, thereby engaging to keep them, and, not keeping
them, pretend that you have only contracted to make every effort to
insure punctuality in keeping them. And this is all the reply you have
to make to the complaints of those whom you have choused. And so, the
world has combined to pay you in your own coin, in order that you may
feel how disagreeable it is to have people, from whom you expect
punctuality, not showing it; but instead of practising it, putting you
off with the excuse that they have made every effort to insure it."</p>

<center>MORAL.</center>

<p>Railway Companies are servants of the public; but if the Director of
any
Railway Company were to be treated by his own domestics and tradesfolk
with the same neglect and inattention that he and his fellows treat the
public with, and were to have agreements and bargains made with himself
violated with the like impudence, he would be mightily incensed and
exasperated. And, instead of assuaging, it would only aggravate his
wrath to tell him that every effort had been made to discharge those
obligations to the fulfilment of which there had been paid small regard,
if any.</p>

<h2>A NUISANCE.</h2>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Mr. Punch,</span>&#8212;I should be very much obliged
if you would put a stop to a
species of annoyance which I am continually subject to. I allude to a
system of 'Notes and Queries,' which is becoming daily more and more
impertinently annoying. These questions are put to me every morning
through the medium of the newspapers, which I am obliged to read, 'just
to be in the world.' I am a poor student, Sir, and have enough to do to
answer questions of a very different description to the following, viz.,
'Do you want luxuriant whiskers?' 'Have you been to &#8212;&#8212; emporium?' 'Do
you bruise your oats?' &amp;c. &amp;c. And then if I take a walk, there
is
scarcely a street in which I am not assailed by a pictorial Barmaid
ejaculating 'Sherry, Sir?' Do, <i>Mr. Punch</i>, allow me, through your
columns, to answer these impertinent questions once for all. I have
<i>not</i> been and never will go to &#8212;&#8212; emporium. My <span class="smcap">Amelia</span>
 doesn't care
about whiskers, and therefore <i>I</i> don't; and as for bruising oats,
and
drinking sherry, 'this my answer:'&#8212;I don't keep horses, and when I want
(and can pay for) wine I'll ask for it.</p>

<p>The head of the Chinese rebellion is extremely indignant with the

<h2>A NEW ZODIACAL LIGHT.</h2>

<p>At the recent Meeting of the British Association, <span class="smcap">Professor
 Glimm</span>, of
Finsterberg, favoured Section A with the outlines of his plan for the
better arrangement of the signs of the zodiac, which, as he truly
remarked, were in a very unsatisfactory state, and not at all in
accordance with the spirit of the age. "What occasion have we," he
asked, "for Libra, the Balance, when we have already the scales of the
Pisces?" He therefore proposes to remove Libra from its control over the
harvest month, and to substitute for it Virga, which, as every
school-boy knows, is the Latin for a threshing machine in common use. As
Aquarius comes under the provisions of the New Cab Act, which declares
that no water-man shall be allowed on the stand, he is to retire on a
pension, and his berth is to be held over for <span class="smcap">Father
 Mathew</span>.</p>

<p>The weapons of Sagittarius, and his mode of conducting the chase,
have
become quite obsolete, and can only excite ridicule in an age which has
made so many improvements in fire-arms. He is therefore to share the
honourable retirement of Aquarius, and his duties and emoluments are to
be divided amongst a troop of shooting stars. These last have petitioned
that Canis Venaticus (the hunting dog) may be allowed to attend them,
but their request cannot be complied with until it has been ascertained
that this celestial pointer will refrain from worrying Taurus and Aries,
and barking at the heels of Virgo. <span class="smcap">Professor Glimm</span>
 has also persuaded
some distinguished members of the Peace Society to arbitrate between the
Gemini, who have not been on visiting terms for many years. By the
intervention of these gentlemen, it is hoped these discreditable
squabbles will be stopped, and Castor and Pollux will be once more seen
in company.</p>

<h2>OUR TOURIST IN PARIS.&#8212;No. 3.</h2>

<p>The Englishman in Paris lives one of two lives: a life of duty or a
life
of pleasure. In the former case he wanders drearily through the Louvre
and the Luxembourg; he makes painful pilgrimages to churches, museums,
and galleries, in the hope of picking up a knowledge of Art. He devotes
this day to St. Denis, the next to Versailles, the third to St. Cloud.
He fills his catalogue and guide-books with annotations, and perhaps
spends a cheerful evening over a diary, in which desperate efforts are
made to distinguish the styles of <span class="smcap">Rubens</span> and <span
 class="smcap">Titian</span>, and the eras of
Notre Dame and the Sainte Chapelle. In the latter case he frequents the
Opéra Comique, the theatres, and the public balls: he breakfasts in the
Palais Royal, and dines at <span class="smcap">Philippe's</span>, and
makes a regular promenade in
the Champs Elysées every afternoon. The well-balanced mind of your
correspondent seizes the advantages of both these systems. He devotes
his morning to the cultivation of his intellect, and the rest of the day
to the gratification of his tastes.</p>

<p>Behold him, then, after a conscientious study of the pictures in the
Louvre, prepared to refresh himself by an airing in the Elysian fields.
What a panorama of superb points of view! The Rue de la Paix, the Place
and Column Vendôme, the Attic Madeleine, the endless arcades of the Rue
de Rivoli, the imperial facade of the Tuileries, its classic gardens,
the noble opening of the Place de la Concorde, with its obelisk and
fountains, and the avenue ending with the sublime Arch of the Star.
Where else can such a group of beauties be found? No wonder the poor
Parisians find London dull and ugly! But the less we talk about the
appearance of our dingy city the better; we must forget Trafalgar Square
and its monuments, and console ourselves with our pavement, our
drainage, and our comfortable firesides.</p>

<p>The sun shines cheerfully, the air is pure, and the philosopher
enters
the Champs Elysées in a state of serene enjoyment, proposing to study
the manners of the great nation. He observes an ancient man by the
wayside in tattered garments, who plays soft tunes on a bass trombone.
No one pays the least attention to this mild minstrelsy. It is a perfect
image of Wisdom talking in the streets, and no man regarding her.
Another poor creature seated on the ground, grinds a feeble tootling
organ amid similar neglect. The French are evidently not a musical
people. The observer passes on to a temple of Punch, at whose exhibition
(in reverence to the august original in England) he is about to assist,
when he is suddenly aroused to a sense of a cruel disappointment. He
might just as well be in Hyde Park. It is the drive by the Serpentine
over again. Why, there's <span class="smcap">Overalls</span>, of the
Blues. There's <span class="smcap">Swellings
Swellings</span>; you never can go anywhere without seeing him. That was
 <span class="smcap">Bob
Hilton</span>, driving the high-stepping grey horse. There goes <span
class="smcap">Threadpaper</span> of
the Foreign Office, with his infant moustache (what the deuce does <i>he</i>
want with a moustache, I should like to know?) There's old <span
class="smcap">Gratings</span>, who
is such a bore at the Club; there's <span class="smcap">Charley
Martingale</span> of the Plungers,
with <span class="smcap">Hooker</span> (known by his friends as the
Bravo) in his wonderful tight
trousers. But who isn't here? Two men behind are talking about the
Metropolitan Handicap and <span class="smcap">Grumbler's</span> chance
of the Derby. Really,
really, this is too bad. The ancient poet asks, "What exile from his
fatherland can leave <i>himself</i> behind?" The question now is what
man, by
departure from his country, can hope to be free from his countrymen? It
is intolerable. How is it possible to take notes of Parisian manners
when you are seized upon by <span class="smcap">Swellings Swellings</span>
 and catechised about the
prospects of the Haymarket Opera? You get rid of him by informing him,
in confidence, that it has been taken by <span class="smcap">Mr. John
Bright</span> for a series of
Bal Masqués and Ballet entertainments, when up come the <span
class="smcap">Bravo</span> and
<span class="smcap">Martingale</span>, who want to know when <span
class="smcap">Pytchley's</span> stud is to be sold. You
profess a sulky ignorance of the subject, and try to get away, when
<span class="smcap">Martingale</span> enters upon a sketch of French
character, which he holds very
low, chiefly on grounds of a sporting nature. Ever see such dogs?&#8212;ever
see such horses?&#8212;ever see such riding and driving?&#8212;ever see such
grooms and coachmen? You should go to one of their steeple-chases and
look at them tumbling about. The last time, at La Marche, white and red
cap came pounding along fifty miles an hour, and pulled up short at the
brook to inquire for the <i>bridge</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>"<i>Ou est le pont, Messieurs? Mon Dieu, je vais perdre! De grace, ou
 est
le pont?</i>" and another man got with his horse on to the top of a
bank,
where he stopped for a quarter-of-an-hour without being able to get off
again, until at last the crowd flicked the unfortunate animal with their
pocket-handkerchiefs into a state of madness, when he jumped down, only
it was on the wrong side, and his rider gave up the adventure.
<span class="smcap">Martingale</span> was also very severe on the
cavalry, whom he described as
tailors mounted on bad cart-horses, and unable to stand for a moment
before British heavies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hooker</span> endorsed the criticisms of his
friend, and called attention to
the cavaliers who pranced up and down the drive. Certainly it was rather
a ludicrous contrast, both for men and cattle, with our exhibition in
Rotten Row. The horses were mostly weedy, leggy, tucked up brutes, all
mane and tail, and worth about two pound ten each. One young fellow, a
tremendous dandy, galloped up and down on a gray Arab-looking pony that
an English gentleman would have put his little boy of twelve upon. The
styles of riding were various. There were the <i>haute école</i> men,
who
rode very long, and showed all their saddle in front of them, and the
Anglo-maniacs, who rode very short, and showed all their saddle behind
them. Some gentlemen seemed disposed to tie their legs together under
their horse's belly; others projected them on each side of his chest
like the cat-heads of a man-of-war. They all rode on the curb, with a
grasp of iron, holding the snaffle in the other hand, perpetually
nagging and spurring and hustling the wretched animals about, till they
did not know what to be at. <span class="smcap">Hooker's</span> honest
Yorkshire heart swelled with
bitterness all the time. "They oughtn't to be trusted out with a horse,"
he said.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
 "It's a shame, by <span class="smcap">Jove</span>! They drive like a
butcher, and ride
like a chummy on a moke" (<span class="smcap">Hooker</span> meant to
say, a sweep on a donkey; but
he always prefers idiomatic expressions, which add great vigour to his
discourse). "However, I won't be unjust to the Mossoos. They can cook a
good dinner, and no mistake. Come to-night, old fellow, and dine with us
in the Rue Montorgueil. There's <span class="smcap">Haycock</span> of
the 190th coming, and we
shall have some of <span class="smcap">Clicquot's</span> Champagne."</p>

<p>Good. We will be there.</p>

<h2>A MUSICAL PUMP.</h2>

<p>A Composer, whom we cannot do less than call a Musical Pump, so full
is
his head of crotchets and water&#8212;has published three watery sheets of
music for the Pianoforte, respectively entitled "The Morning Mist," "The
Rainbow," and "The Waterfall." Why should he stop here? why not
thoroughly drain the subject? why not fathom it in all its depths, until
he has not left a drop of water that can be sounded, or out of which any
sound can be got, by any other composer? In our liberality, we beg to
suggest a few subjects for him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Shower of Rain</span>&#8212;dedicated to the Lessee
 of Vauxhall, with an
illuminated frontispiece, showing a view of the "Ten Thousand additional
Lamps," in water colours.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Umbrella Galop</span>, and <span
class="smcap">Parasol Polka</span>, dedicated to the fair frequenters
of the Horticultural and Botanical Gardens&#8212;with a fine running
accompaniment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Deluge</span>&#8212;humbly inscribed to <span
class="smcap">Lord Maidstone</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Mackintosh March</span>&#8212;with a view of
Chobham Camp&#8212;and a beautiful
waterproof wrapper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Bucket of Water</span>&#8212;A composition for the
milk-pail.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Overflow</span>&#8212;with a splendid engraving of
the Surrey Zoological
Gardens, showing the overflow caused by a little Poole. "Exceedingly
playful."&#8212;<i>Musical Review.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Cats and Dogs' Schottishe</span>, as danced
at all the Scottish Fêtes in
Holland Park, Cremorne, &amp;c.</p>

<p>And when the subject of rain-water is fairly pumped out, there are
all
the other atmospheric changes, of which our climate offers such a
tempting variety, and some of which must surely contain a few of the
elements of success. We scarcely know which are the most ridiculous&#8212;the
titles that are given now-a-days to new shirts, or the subjects that are
chosen, as the sources of inspiration, by our musical composers.</p>

<hr />

<h4>Extreme Conscientiousness.</h4>

<p>The <i>Field</i> newspaper prides itself in giving "No Reports of
Prize
Fights." So conscientious is the paper in this particular, that it has
announced its determination&#8212;in the event of the decimal coinage being
adopted&#8212;to turn away every farthing, rather than derive a profit from a
single <i>mil</i>.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="smcap">Cause and Effect.</span>&#8212;It is said that a cause
is always followed by effect,
but this is not the case at all events at law, where a cause is too
frequently followed by "No Effects."</p>

<h2>THE LAWYERS ABROAD.</h2>

<p>Our latest advices inform of us of an extensive inundation of the

It is impossible to get into a steamer without having "with you <span
class="smcap">Mr.
Sergeant Somebody</span>," or finding a Judge "sitting in error" by
taking
possession of the camp-stool we have for an instant quitted. Every town
in Switzerland has its proportion of British Lawyers. Peru the other day
could boast of two justices besides its own; and many a legal luminary
has been exploring the summits of the Jura, as an agreeable change from
his habitual contemplation of the <i>summun jus</i>. Equity draftsmen
instead
of drawing conveyances have been glad to get conveyances to draw them;
and the common lawyer has forgotten every other motion but locomotion,
which, at this season of the year, is almost a motion of course. The
diligences nearly all over the Continent are so unusually loaded, that
there is scarcely a vacant corner to be found in any one of them, but we
cannot be surprised that when so many lawyers are travelling by them
they should be rather heavily charged.</p>

<h2>A CITY WITHOUT SMOKE!</h2>

<p>That a city can exist without Smoke, we beg to refer our readers for
the
proof of such a possibility to <span class="smcap">Mr. Burford's</span>
Panorama in Leicester
Square. There they will be able to admire, in all its beauty and
undefiled cleanliness, the lovely City of Mexico. You are standing on
the top of the Grand Cathedral, and, look in all directions as you will,
you cannot see the smallest wreath of smoke curling about the place.
Now, we should like to see the curl taken out of London in a similar
manner. It may not look, perhaps, so grand, so showy and glittering as
Mexico, but still it may, in its new aspect, appear sufficiently
tempting to induce Mr. <span class="smcap">Burford</span> to select it
as the subject of some
future Panorama. The probability is, we should not know it again as the
same city, in which we are now, like so many living chimneys, inhaling
and exhaling smoke all day long. The new Zealander, when he does view
the ruins of our sooty metropolis from London Bridge, would be able to
see them at all events to greater advantage then than he would if he
were to take his private view from one of the parapets to-morrow. For
our own selves, we are most anxious to see how London would look without
smoke&#8212;for, in the name of darkness, it looks ugly enough with it.</p>

<h2>ANOTHER INSULT FROM THE SAXON.</h2>

<center>(<i>From "The Nation.</i>")</center>

<p>Another insult, hot and hissing, has been flung in the scar-seamed
face
of Ireland from the Saxon! And the Crystal Palace&#8212;or, rather, the
Vitreous Dungeon for Ireland's liberties&#8212;was the appointed scene of the
atrocity. Among the more sublimating objects was the venerable form of
<span class="smcap">O'Connell</span> (in something harder than wax!)
surrounded by a crowd of his
own finest peasantry.</p>

<p>"That's <span class="smcap">O'Connell</span>," said the <span
class="smcap">Queen</span>.</p>

<p>"And very like him," said <span class="smcap">Prince Albert</span>.
And with all respect for his
Royal Highness&#8212;(for, as we are slaves, we have learned to treat the
Saxon with respect!) with all respect we ask, how he should presume to
know it was like the deified lineaments of the sublime Liberator?&#8212;"And
very like him!" said the Queen's husband; but&#8212;patience is the badge of
all our tribe, and we'll let <i>that</i> pass.</p>

<p>But the withering insult is now to be recorded; if it do not, as we
write it, turn our steel pen red-hot, and singe the paper into flames!</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Duke of Wellington</span>&#8212;the second Duke&#8212;the
 son of <span class="smcap">O'Connell's</span> "stunted
corporal"&#8212;yes, Dux Secundus&#8212;presumed to "buy <span class="smcap">O'Connell</span>
 and the
peasantry!"</p>

<p>Think of that, oh countrymen! The <span class="smcap">Duke of
Wellington</span> dared to put his
hand into his pocket, and to take out so much tax-wrung, Saxon gold,
and&#8212;counting it piece by piece&#8212;he laid it down as the price of
<span class="smcap">O'Connell</span>!</p>

<p>What did he mean by that cowardly, atrocious, ready-money
transaction?
Why, this: by purchasing <span class="smcap">O'Connell</span> he
intended to fling this burning
libel in the face of Ireland&#8212;he wished to show it as his decided
opinion that <span class="smcap">O'Connell</span> <i>could be bought!!!</i></p>

<p>But the day of reckoning with the Saxon <i>will</i> come. Meantime,
if we hug
our chain, it is only to count and <i>pay for</i> the links!</p>

<h2>A CLERK PAID IN KIND.</h2>

<p>Law is looking up at Manchester&#8212;to judge from a paragraph in the
<i>Morning Herald</i>; to wit&#8212;</p>

<blockquote><p>"<span class="smcap">Manchester Liberalism.</span>&#8212;The
following announcement has been posted
on the walls of the Manchester Law Library:&#8212;'An experienced clerk,
who writes a good hand, is wanted by a respectable solicitor in
Manchester. Salary 7<i>s.</i> per week, with perquisites in the shape of
cast-off clothes. Apply to the librarian.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>Dull literalism would denounce the respectable solicitor who proposes
 to
pay an experienced clerk principally in cast-off clothes, as a screw.
Many a plodding fellow will expatiate on the unreasonableness on the
part of a legal gentleman who remunerates a clerk on this scale, of
being astonished that the said clerk should go seedy, or stretch forth
his hand and commit acts contrary to ordinances and statutes in such
case made and provided. It will occur to the stolid mind that the offer
of a stipend of old clothes is not likely to attract any clerk of
experience, beyond that of a Jew salesman. But the true man of figures,
he who understands the language of Fancy, revelling in metaphor,
perceives at once that the proposition which seems so stingy is, in
fact, very liberal. He discerns that by cast-off clothes is meant a
share in the business, consisting in those suits, which though
considerably profitable, are not of sufficient importance to be attended
to by the head of the establishment. It is pleasing to find the language
of poetry thus obtaining, in a profession of which the phraseology has
hitherto been so very unimaginative.</p>

<hr />

<h4>Washing Made Agreeable.</h4>

<p>There is no washing, after all, like gold-washing. It is the kind of
washing that pays the best, and the only one that a gentleman can, with
credit, put his hands to.

<h2>CLASSICALITIES FOR THE NEW COINAGE.</h2>

<p>In adopting the decimal coinage, it would be desirable to alter as
little as possible the existing nomenclature of the <span class="smcap">Queen's</span>
 cash. The
idea of the decimal may be expressed by the slightest variation of a
term in vernacular use to denote a certain piece of money. By the change
of a letter in the word "Tanner," the sixpence might, nominally, be
retained to the great bulk of the people; whilst, by the conversion
alluded to, namely, into "Tenner," the new elements of its constitution
would be at the same time signified. The novel word "Mil," should be
rejected; and for it might be substituted the similarly sounding but
more familiar name of "Bill," the adoption of which may be recommended
on the ground of analogy, as the shilling has been already long stamped
with the popular diminutive of "Bob." If the somewhat fanciful
expression "Mil," or "Mill," is employed, the principle of its
derivation should be consistently carried out. The words "Winder,"
"Bender," "Twister," "Topper," and "Stunner," might be borrowed to
designate money, which itself should change its present correct
appellation for the more sportive and appropriate title of Blunt. The
mutation of "Florin" into "Floorer" would be obviously called for, and
the crown piece might be neatly styled a "Punisher," as being the
well-known amount of the fine for inebriety.</p>

<p>On all the coins emanating from the pugilistic mint, it would be
requisite that the Lion and the Unicorn should be fighting; and whilst
V. R. figured on one side of them, P. R. should be stamped on the other,
that it might in every respect be characterised by the true ring.</p>

<h2>PUNCH'S POTATO PROPHECY.</h2>

<p class="i0">The candle-stick maker,</p>

<p>So runs the childish doggrel; but <i>Punch</i> heard in that
shambling verse
a musical promise; and hearing, foretold the coming time when, from the
very blight that smote the people of Ireland through Ireland's potatos,
there should be peace and plenty for Ireland regenerate. And is it not
so? Answer with one of your wildest roars, oh, Lion of Judah! Is it not

<h2>IRON BARS OF MUSIC.</h2>

<p>We have often wished that we could suggest anything that would afford
some scope for the unemployed ability of the artists of our almost
extinct English Opera. Here, in an advertisement out of the <i>Times</i>,
appears to be something like an opening for one of them&#8212;if the foreign
predilections of our superior classes have not starved them all:&#8212;</p>

<blockquote><p>ORGAN.&#8212;WANTED, a respectable man to act as TURNKEY in a
County
Prison. One who understands music, can play the Organ, and sing bass
would be preferred. For further particulars apply, post paid, to T.
T. S., Post-office, Bath.</p></blockquote>

<p>The popular air of "<i>Still so gently o'er me stealing</i>," will
immediately suggest itself as one of the first airs that would be called
for from the musical turnkey, having been transposed so as to be sung in
the bass, which "would be preferred." Any one who had personated the
gaoler in the vernacular version of <i>Fidelio</i> would, however, be
the man
for the situation; and it is pleasing to imagine such a respectable
vocalist leading the Prison Chorus at the head of real convicts. A
pretty idea, too, is that of a Nightingale within four stone walls,
beguiling the tedium of confinement with his "jug-jug." Of course the
harmonious turnkey would enchant his incarcerated audience by his
performance of the Witch music of <span class="smcap">Matthew Locke</span>.
 That he should also be
an organist is a good notion; phrenologists will admit it to be
judicious to play the organ of tune against that of acquisitiveness or
theft, and all other human organs out of tune and discordant with man's
better nature. Talking of the organ, <span class="smcap">Sebastian Bach</span>
 would have been just
the very turnkey in request, for he was a master of that noble
instrument; and the kind of piece which he most delighted in performing
thereon was a <span class="smcap">Quod</span>-<i>libet</i>.</p>

<p>It is to be hoped that the cultivation of music will be introduced at
Newgate; and then, perhaps, we shall at last witness a genuine
representation of the <i>Beggar's Opera</i>.</p>

<h2>OUR TOURIST IN PARIS.&#8212;No. 4.</h2>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/118.png" alt="W" class="cap" width="30%" />

<p class="cap_3">WHEN, Sir, you selected me from the crowd of eminent
persons who
solicited the honour of furnishing you with their impressions of the
French metropolis, you were good enough to attribute to me an uncommon
impartiality and serenity of mind. "That impartiality," you observed
with your usual force and felicity of language, "will preserve your
communications from the onesidedness that usually deforms a traveller's
views of foreign country." My modesty, Sir, (almost amounting to
bashfulness) is well known to you, but I will venture to say that you
were correct in your estimate. I feel myself equally free from the
sturdy prepossessions nourished by <span class="smcap">Mr. Dowlas</span>
 of Mecklenburgh Square and
the rose-coloured delusions which captivate young <span class="smcap">Threadpaper</span>
 of the
Foreign Office. The former gentleman marches through this city in
company with <span class="smcap">Mrs. D.</span> and the girls, armed
with a guide-book and a pocket
map, and finds all barren. The latter wishes to introduce absolute
government into England, supported by an army of five hundred thousand
men and a censorship of the press. <span class="smcap">Threadpaper</span>
 is of tender years; his
moustache is downy, indeed hardly visible without a glass; he will grown
wiser with time, but <span class="smcap">Mr. Dowlas</span>, I very much
fear, is beyond all cure.</p>
</div>

<p>D., you old humbug! what do you mean by uttering your shallow vulgar
criticism on the greatest nation of Continental Europe? You know nothing
of their history, except that they were beaten at the battle of
Waterloo; you can't speak a word of their language; you can't read one
of their newspapers; you are supremely ignorant of their character and
institutions, and yet you treat them as a mob of hairdressers, dancing
masters, and cooks (and not good cooks either), and exult in the
time-honoured conviction that one Englishman can thrash two Frenchmen.
<span class="smcap">Dowlas</span>, attend to me, I am going to talk
about taste&#8212;a word that ought
to excite shame and anguish in your mind. For a quarter of a century you
have been smothering the world with printed fabrics of fantastic and
horrible ugliness. Millions upon millions of yards of these abominations
have found their way into every nook and corner of the world. Remote
tribes of wandering Tartars and the squaws of painted Choktaws have clad
their bodies and depraved their souls with your outrageous patterns.
Bales marked with the well-known <span class="smcap">D.</span> (oh, how
could you, <span class="smcap">Mr. Dowlas</span>,
Sir?) have carried their baleful influence into the innocent populations
of the Peaceful Ocean. The least hideous of these productions are those
you have stolen (and spoiled) from the French, and if there is any
improvement in your patterns of late years, it is entirely to be
attributed to your piracy of French designs.</p>

<p>The fact is, that France has become the Mistress of Arts to the
world.
If England lives in a fever of industry, <i>she</i> lives in a fever of
invention. Every novelty we have is due to her restless creative spirit.
In arts, in letters, in philosophy, she scatters abroad new ideas with
unsparing profusion; other nations, following with unequal steps,
treasure up what falls, and claim it as their own. This exuberance of
fancy is only the result of the universal artistic feeling which seems
to animate her citizens. You cannot go anywhere in Paris without being
conscious of this. Every shop window is a picture. Look at that
pastrycook's. A few pieces of china and half-a-dozen bon-bon boxes form
a composition that is really charming. Is there any one from Marlborough
House could do it as well? Only think of the tons of three-cornered
tarts and Bath buns that form the decoration of a London confectioner's.
And yet this pretty arrangement is due to the intuitive taste of the
little scrubby ignorant daughter of the people who serves in the shop. I
will not draw your attention to the quiet becoming style of her dress,
because you have often confessed to me in private your admiration of
Parisian toilettes, though in the presence of <span class="smcap">Mrs.
D.</span> you loudly affect
to prefer the dowdy manner adopted by that lady in common with the most
part of her countrywomen. I will, therefore, make no further mention of
ladies' costume, only protesting that, in my opinion, all Frenchwomen in
their degree dress to perfection, and that an ugly bonnet is no certain
proof of wisdom or goodness as is generally supposed.</p>

<p>Turn to the houses, and compare their gay ornate appearance with the
dismal monotonous streets of London. Every one has its separate
character. The portal is of sculptured stone, always decent and often of
beautiful design. A little bit of carved cornice, a simple moulding
round the windows gives individuality and interest to the upper part
without any of the astounding architectural eccentricities of Regent
Street. Enter, and you will find the furniture of even the humbler
occupants varied, characteristic, and pretty. Where ornament is
attempted, it is well chosen and sparingly introduced. A beautiful
cabinet, a few small pictures, a group or two in bronze, some exquisite
china&#8212;quite a contrast to the overwhelming magnificence of English
upholstery. I know, <span class="smcap">Dowlas</span>, you gave a <i>carte
 blanche</i> to <span class="smcap">Jobkins</span> and
<span class="smcap">Son</span> for your house in Mecklenburgh Square.
Well, well&#8212;if the subject is
a painful one we will not pursue it; though I must say that I think six
copies of the peacocky young woman in fetters, called for some
inscrutable reason the Greek Slave, rather too much for two
drawing-rooms (couldn't you send up a pair to the best bed-room, and one
to the butler's pantry?) and I may also take this opportunity of
informing <span class="smcap">Jobkins, Junior</span>, who does the
"tasty" business of his firm,
that merely multiplying expensive tables and chairs, and daubing
everything over with gold, though it may satisfactorily swell the bill,
shows a miserable want of fancy and cleverness in a decorator.</p>

<p>I quite admit the solidity and conscientiousness of English
workmanship.
We buy a frightful table in Bond Street, and, behold, it will last for
ever. The drawers in <span class="smcap">Dowlas's</span> house are as
delightful to open and shut
as they are horrible to look at. English boots will outlast French
boots, and English gloves French gloves. Whatever may have been the case
years ago, it is a great mistake to suppose that these articles are
better now in Paris than in London. The great difference is shortly
this<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5"
 class="fnanchor">[5]</a>&#8212;our artists are tradesmen and their tradesmen
are artists. In
all articles of simple usefulness we have an unquestionable superiority,
but where something more than convenience or durability is required our
designers seem quite helpless. A certain funeral car will occur to many
as an example of this truth, and, perhaps, by malicious persons, will be
taken to shew how much or how little is to be expected from Government
Schools of Art.</p>

<p>The Tourist is aware that no one can walk about Paris without seeing
abundant evidences of the coarsest moral and social feeling, and claims
an infinitely higher position for his own countrymen and countrywomen in
this respect. He also recollects that he has already ridiculed the dress
of Frenchmen, and sees that this may be supposed inconsistent with a
sweeping panegyric on French taste. But this is<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span> an exception that
proves the rule. A Frenchman's <i>theory</i> of dress is wrong. He
always
wants to be conspicuous and picturesque. Hence, nothing is too singular
and showy for him. He gets himself up, as if for the stage, with velvet
and fur and beard and moustache, and exhausts the resources of his
inventive mind for new and still more <i>piquant</i> combinations. When
he
turns his attentions to the chase, the result is something worth seeing,
and no mistake, as will be more plainly seen by a picture of a party of
sporting gentlemen going out shooting. But these comicalities are
eschewed by the genuine "swells," who adopt our sober English notions of
masculine costume, and, indeed, dress exactly like Englishmen. The
advice of <i>Polonius</i> to <i>Laertes</i> will literally apply to the
matter at
the present day:&#8212;</p>

<div class="poem1"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy.</p>
<p class="i0">But <i>not expressed in fancy</i>&#8212;rich, not gaudy&#8212;</p>
<p class="i0">For the apparel oft proclaims the man.</p>
<p class="i0">And they in France <i>of the best rank and station</i></p>
<p class="i0">Are most select and generous, chief in that&#8212;"</p>
</div></div>

<h2>SPIRITED CONDUCT OF A PUBLIC COMPANY.</h2>

<p>The Greenwich Steamboats have recently been employed in the
important,
but somewhat dangerous, service of destroying the various piers, at
which they call for passengers. These absurd and useless
structures&#8212;which are usually composed of three or four superannuated
barges, loosely connected by a twopenny cord; several flights of stairs,
leading up into the air and down again, on to the next pier and back
again, or, indeed, anywhere but into the boats; a hut which combines the
accommodation of a watch-box with the cleanliness of a pigstye, and a
series of gangways which are intended to accommodate themselves to the
rising and falling of the tide, but which invariably stick fast at the
wrong end, and either carry the unfortunate traveller some 20 feet above
the wharf, or threaten to precipitate him down a sort of Montagne Russe
into the water;&#8212;these agglomerations of tar, dirt, touchwood, and
rope-yarn, have so long encumbered and disfigured the bank of the river
that the Directors of the Greenwich steamboats have come to the
resolution which their boats have been carrying out.</p>

<p>The plan, on which the work of demolition is carried on, is as
follows:
The captain drives the boat stem on to the pier, without giving any
order to reverse the engines, and the immediate consequence is a most
satisfactory collision. It is not true, however, that the French, in
despair at ever being able to effect a landing in London over these
piers, have bribed the Directors to destroy these bulwarks of the river.
Nor are the Directors following the example of the Scotch Baronet, who
has just pulled down a pier on his estate, because the boats stopped at
it on Sunday. The cases are quite different, for the Scotch piers are
only private, or representative, and can be removed at pleasure, whereas
the London piers have persevered in their career of uselessness for many
ages, and can only be got rid of by violent measures.</p>

<h2>PRINCE ALBERT, THE CZAR, AND THE TURK.</h2>

<p>"For Heaven's sake, gentlemen, <i>don't</i> nail the poor man's ears
to the
pump!"</p>

<p>Such was the benevolent exclamation of <span class="smcap">Tyger
Roche</span> (an Irish fire-eater
of the last century) when he beheld a certain attorney within the walls
of Dublin Jail. And the prayer was sufficient; for no sooner was it
uttered, than the hapless lawyer was in the clutches of invoked
persecutors, and hammer and nails hotly sought for.</p>

<p>Our friend the <i>Spectator</i>, oddly enough, is, for once, very
like <span class="smcap">Tyger
Roche.</span> He says&#8212;</p>

<blockquote><p>"It is evident that a serious disturbance in Europe might
 be very
inconvenient to the minor German Powers; and that fact has <i>perhaps</i>
suggested <i>the rough guess</i>, that a Prince bound up with German
interests by family relations, has used his position near the
British Sovereign for the purpose of inducing England to assist in
hushing up the quarrel, with scanty regard to the justice of the
case; <i>in short, that</i> <span class="smcap">Prince Albert</span> has
 induced England to abandon
her pledge and her ally!"</p></blockquote>

<p>The <i>Spectator</i> having made "the rough guess," reasons on it in
his own
logical way, and concludes with these convincing words&#8212;</p>

<blockquote><p>"<i>We do not believe</i> that <span class="smcap">Prince
 Albert</span> has so far forgotten his
happy and exalted duty, of which he has shown so just an
appreciation, by officious meddling with affairs which are not his."</p></blockquote>

<p>That the <i>Spectator</i>, the Esquimaux of the Press&#8212;for somehow he
always
appears to <i>Punch</i> in a suit of sealskin, with a very blue nose,
prepared, if necessary, to harpoon the whale that shall supply his
midnight oil&#8212;that the cold <i>Spectator</i> should suggest such a charge
against <span class="smcap">Prince Albert</span> merely to express a
disbelief is, at least, a very
unnecessary trouble.</p>

<p>"Don't nail the poor man's ears to the pump!" cries <span

<p class="cap_3">THE <i>Times</i>, in a letter from Grenoble, states
that the Trappists in the
neighbourhood of La Salette are busy in the manufacture of a beverage
which, from the writer's description, seems to be about identical with
that which is produced by <span class="smcap">Messrs. Seager &amp; Evans</span>.
 We congratulate the
worthy monks upon taking to honest gin-spinning, which is a much more
laudable occupation than weaving toils to entangle simpletons. We should
think this order must be rather numerous in the district in question, as
surely all those must have been regular Trappists, who were concerned in
getting up the enormous hoax which has given it celebrity.</p>
</div>

<p>It seems that they have entrapped some gulls of the <span

were not up to Trap: but we should have considered even that common
marine fowl, the Booby, too old a bird to be capable of being caught by
chaff so extremely palpable.</p>

<h2>PEBBLES PICKED UP AT THE SEA-SHORE.</h2>

<center>BY A SENTIMENTAL OLD YOUNG LADY.</center>

<p>One's existence down here is divided between donkey-riding and
novel-reading&#8212;pretty exercises for the mind and body! It would be
difficult to say which were the slowest&#8212;the donkeys or the novels. It's
very strange, but how extremely rare it is you come across a donkey or a
novel that's in the least moving!</p>

<p>Youth writes its hopes upon the sand, and Age advances, like the sea,
and washes them all out.</p>

<p>We raffle, and raffle our best affections away, like shillings at the
Library, and Man looks coldly on, and smilingly says, "Better luck,
Miss, next time."</p>

<p>I am sure that the sand, with which Time has filled his hour-glass,
must
have been picked up at a watering-place, for nowhere else does the time
run on so slowly, or the hours succeed one another with such provoking
similarity.</p>

<p>It is very curious that the sea, which brings the colour back to our
cheeks, generally takes it from our ribbons!</p>

<p>It is the same with dispositions as with bonnets; it is not every one
that can stand the sea-side.</p>

<p>Scandal is a rank weed which is generally found in great profusion
near
the sea-coast.</p>

<p>A watering-place is a harbour of refuge, that we, poor weak vessels,
after having been tossed about for nine months in the year, are obliged,
during the other three, to put into for repairs.</p>

<p>I am frequently reminded, when I see a party about to start in a
pleasure boat, of the effect of a London season. Every one is so gay and
blooming, so full of health and spirits at the starting, but how pale,
dejected, dragged, drenched, and fairly sickened they look, if you
chance to see them returning at the end of it!</p>

<h2>THE INSTITUTION OF OUR SPECTRE OF CHELSEA.</h2>

<p>The following "Pastoral" has been published by an obscure individual,
who pretends to adopt a certain episcopal style.</p>

<p>To the Inhabitants of Chelsea, Brompton, Fulham, Kensington, and the
Neighbourhood, Health and Good Digestion.</p>

<p>Respectable and Intelligent,&#8212;From the Apparition of <span class="smcap">Giles
Scroggins</span> of tuneful memory, to that of the Head of the Woolly Quadruped
which manifested itself to <span class="smcap">William White</span>, there was no want of spectral
appearances sufficient to convince the enlightened British Public of the
existence of Ghosts. Not to mention the unfortunate <span class="smcap">Miss Bailey</span>, who,
after suspension by the cincture of her own stocking, revisited an
unprincipled <span class="smcap">Captain Smith</span>, nor to say more than is necessary of the
Ghost of Cock Lane, it may suffice to cite the instance of the
Hammersmith Ghost which, as is well known, appeared to, and terrified a
great many people. And now lately, in this very place, which is not far
from that, there has appeared a Ghost, which has frightened multitudes;
as countless thousands among you are able to testify.</p>

<p>But the incredulous&#8212;insensible to the force of table rappings,
disbelieving the prodigies of clairvoyance, and deriding the wonderful
visions of the Crystal&#8212;who, in short, ascribe all the supernatural
events of the day, which are very numerous, to imagination or fraud,
will doubtless, after a short time, by the lapse whereof the
recollection of the fact shall have been weakened, dispute or deny the
truth of the Chelsea Ghost, and attribute the authentic narrative
thereof to the incredible <span class="smcap">Walker</span>.</p>

<p>Lest, therefore, the memory of this so wonderful Apparition should
perish, and in order that, on the contrary, its fame may endure for
ages, we have decreed to erect a Spirituous Establishment, in the
immediate vicinity of the house wherein it took place, namely, in Pond
Street, Chelsea, to be called and known by the name and sign of the
Ghost and Goblet, which all are invited to frequent, and partake of the
refreshment of spirits.</p>

<p>Beneath the edifice to be reared under these auspices, there will be
provided a subterranean retreat, bearing the name of The Shades, in
further allusion to the miracle which it is intended to commemorate.</p>

<p>A confraternity of the Ghost and Goblet has already been formed for
the
purpose of celebrating with an appropriate banquet the approaching
Festival of Michaelmas. Additional Members may be enrolled at 6<i>d.</i>
 per
week each.</p>

<p>The following indulgences are promised to those who repair to the
Hostelry of the Ghost and Goblet with the usual dispositions:&#8212;</p>

<p>Unlimited indulgence in Roast Goose, on the aforesaid Festival of
Michaelmas, which will also be the Anniversary of the Foundation,<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
on condition of eating with the goose an optional quantity of mashed
turnip, in order to signify the demolition of that Lantern to which
profane scepticism would refer supernatural appearances.</p>

<p>Indulgence in brandy, gin, rum, Hollands, and whiskey; in superior
ale,
porter, and stout; and in genuine foreign wines and liqueurs&#8212;to any
extent, on condition of ringing the bell, or calling the waiter, and
repeating the proper order for the liquor as often as may be requisite.</p>

<p>Indulgence in tea and shrimps.</p>

<p>Indulgence in tobacco for any term of hours; the hostelry remaining
open.</p>

<p>Indulgence of the same duration in the amusement afforded by a good
dry
skittle ground.</p>

<p>Indulgence above stairs in the exercise of dancing; on condition of
executing the proper movements to the tune of "<i>Pop goes the Weasel</i>,"
or
 whatsoever other measure may be prescribed by popularity.</p>

<p>Indulgence in the delights of harmony in the Shades below: on
condition
of expressing a desire for refreshment.</p>

<p>To secure the full benefit of these Indulgences it will be only
necessary, further, to pay for them; and that this may the more
conveniently be done they will be supplied on the most liberal scale of
charges.</p>

<p>In addition to the Skittle Ground, there will be provided a Bowling
Green, surrounded with a Ghost's Walk, adorned with Winking Statues,
Bleeding Pictures, and other objects of like nature calculated to edify
the faithful in such matters. In conclusion, Respectable and
Intelligent, as touching liquor, we profess ourselves ever ready to
supply you</p>

<p>The wonders of steam at Manchester and other great manufacturing
towns
are quite eclipsed by the triumph at which mechanical science has
arrived in an obscure locality. Witness this advertisement, extracted
from the <i>Cambridge Chronicle</i> of the 10th instant:</p>

<blockquote><p>WANTED in a Clergyman's family in the country, a FOOTMAN,
 <i>which</i>
must also have a knowledge of Gardening. For particulars address
X.Y., Post Office, Caxton.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Footman <i>which</i> is wanted in a Clergyman's family, is, of
course, a
Machine; as the neuter pronoun, by the tenet of <span class="smcap">Murray</span>,
 held of course
by every clergyman, is to be applied to animals and inanimate things;
and no known animal is capable of a Footman's place. The Footman thus
wanted might have been supposed to be a trivet, but for the requisition
that it shall have a knowledge of gardening. This proves that it must be
an Engine&#8212;and in part a Garden Engine&#8212;endowed with intellectual
faculties. That it is advertised for is sufficient evidence that it
exists.</p>

<p>Necessity is the mother of invention; and the dearth of labour,
combined
with the insolence, unthrift, and dishonesty of servants, has compelled
some clever mechanist to devise the sort of Footman which is wanted by
the clergyman; and has been long in general request.</p>

<p>How such a domestic could have been constructed; how it was possible
to
make a lackey that should not only clean boots and wait at table, but
dig, and prune, and plant, and exercise intelligence, moreover, in these
horticultural operations, it is difficult to conceive. Imagination
staggers at the idea of a Steam Flunkey. The <span class="smcap">Mr.
Smee</span>, who resolves
thought into electrical action, may suppose that galvanism might have
served to vivify the apparatus, and cause the fibres of its artificial
brain to quiver with those vibrations which constitute perception,
memory, and understanding. But if mind consists in vibrations, the
abilities of a <span class="smcap">Shakspere</span> are no great shakes;
 therefore we cannot accept
such a theory of the constitution of the Footman which is wanted in a
Clergyman's family.</p>

<p>The mysterious agency concerned in Table Turning, belief in which has
 in
some minds survived its refutation by <span class="smcap">Faraday</span>,
 we should rather consider
to be the animating principle of this <span class="smcap">Frankenstein's</span>
 Androides or
<span class="smcap">Andrewoides</span>, artificial Andrew or automatic
John Thomas.</p>

<p>The female domestics in the family of the clergyman are, of course,
of a
nature similar to that of the manservant which is wanted there, since no
housemaid or cook could stay in a house where a Footman was kept
referred to by the neuter pronoun, which, and consequently where the
Footman was an Inanimate Thing.</p>

<h4>A Fable for Mr. Commissioner Murphy.</h4>

<p>Once upon a time, a lot of murphies&#8212;<i>id est</i> potatoes&#8212;were put
in a
pot together. "Now, boys"&#8212;said one of the praties&#8212;"as we'll all be in
hot water&#8212;all of a bilin'&#8212;wobble as we may, for the credit of ould
Ireland&#8212;don't let us <i>split</i> on one another."</p>

<hr />

<h4>The Main Stays of Science.</h4>

<p>The <i>savans</i> at Hull have lately been giving some very
interesting
results of the trial of the strength of "stays." Surely this department
should have been left to a female committee, for the true strength of
"stays" can only be ascertained by experiments in very tight lacing.</p>

<h4>A NEW TIDE OF EMIGRATION.</h4>

<p>Gold has been discovered in Scotland. This discovery may work perhaps
 a
miracle. It may have the effect of sending all the Scotchmen, who for
years have left their native country, "bock again."</p>

<h2>BRITISH ENTERPRISE.</h2>

<div class="drop">

<p class="cap_3">AN opulent Bill-sticker has, we understand, made offers
 to the leader of
the Chinese insurgent forces to rent of him, in the event of his being
made Emperor, the renowned wall of China. The sum offered has not
transpired, but it is said to be something extremely munificent. It is
the billsticker's intention, as soon as he obtains an imperial grant, to
form a company of persons who spend large sums of money every year in
advertisements, and to cover the entire length of the wall with their
bills and posters, a larger price being, of course, charged for those
which will be posted inside than for those outside the wall, where
comparatively but few people will be able to see them. The bills will be
in English, or specially translated into Chinese, at the option of the
advertisers. In the event of China being thrown open to English
commerce&#8212;and there is, at present, every opening of such a fact&#8212;it
will be at once seen what "a desirable medium for advertisements" this
national posting-station will be. So favourably is the scheme
entertained by some of our leading advertisers, that already have 12,000
miles of that part of the wall, which runs through the most densely
populated districts of the Empire, been bespoken at an enormous rental.
The company will be announced in a few days, and it is expected that the
shares will be quoted on the 'Change at a heavy premium the very first
day. <span class="smcap">Mr. Bernal Osborn</span> has been heard to say,
 "that next to a celebrated
Marquis's property, it will be the largest hoarding in the world," and
there is no doubt it will be. All our puffing tailors, pill-merchants,
quack medicine-sellers, and Cambridge Sherry dealers, are actively on
the look-out. Professor Liebig's testimonial in favour of Bitter Beer is
already printed in all the Chinese dialects, only waiting to be pasted
up. We shall keep our eye upon the wall.</p>

<h2>DEAR ENTERTAINMENT FOR DEAR CREATURES.</h2>

<p class="salute">"<span class="smcap">My dear Punch</span>,</p>

<p>"There is no doubt that the prodigious expenses of hotels are&#8212;as I
overheard certain <i>gentlemen</i> say&#8212;in a great measure owing to us
<i>confounded women.</i> We cause so many rooms to have to be kept up on
 our
account. Why can't we&#8212;as they further asked, with a <i>stronger</i>
expression&#8212;be content with a decent coffee-room, instead of requiring a
separate sitting apartment? Why? I asked myself the same question, and
being unable to answer it, I thought the next time I was out with
Charles I would go into the coffee-room and not be <i>confounded.</i> So
 the
other day when he took me to one of those inns which a letter I read in
the <i>Times</i> calls a "Hotel of recreation", I insisted on our dining
 in
the public room. There were some gentlemen sitting there that we have
since met in society, when they behaved in such a way that I couldn't
think what they meant, until at last I found that we were looked upon as
improper people because I had been seen at dinner in the coffee-room of
a tavern! When I discovered this I felt <i>confounded</i> indeed. It
seems
that I have committed an offence against society, everybody is so cool
to me, and really, if it were not for the contempt I feel for such
slaves of custom and prejudice, and the support I derive from the
knowledge that I have pleased my husband, and saved us both money, I
should be dreadfully grieved. But his approbation, and that of my own
conscience, are quite enough for me; however, as that is not quite the
case, I am afraid, with all women, the consequence is that they won't
brave the world, and go in the coffee-room. I must confess, <i>Mr. Punch</i>,
that before we take all the credit for what is called in novels the
'Self Sacrifice of Woman' which is given us, we might as well immolate a
little of our conventionality on the altar of domestic happiness. I am
sure that Judy is of the same mind as your equally constant admirer,</p>

<h4>Strikes to be Lauded.</h4>

<p>We are glad to see that the needlewomen have at last struck, and we
wish
another class of the overworked and underpaid would follow their
example, the working clergy. Such a course would not be uncanonical. A
bishop, to be sure, is required to be "no striker," nor has he occasion
to be one with his thousands a year; but the case is very different with
the curate who has only twenty pounds.</p>

<blockquote><p>"The Steppes of Russia are long dreary tracts, extremely tedious and

<p>"If I had my way I would very soon make the Russians leave the

<div class="drop">

<p class="cap_2">SOME of <i>Mr. Punch's</i> contemporaries have been
circulating, together
with other small change, an account of a plant, newly discovered in
California by a Viennese. This plant, they say, "is about a foot in
height, and fades away in May, revealing to the astonished botanist a
ball of natural soap, contained within its stalk, and superior to the
best brown Windsor." They have forgotten, however, to add some
particulars, which <i>Mr. Punch</i>, in his zeal for the public service,
 has
taken pains to collect. He has ascertained that, out of one hundred and
twenty-nine persons who have read this paragraph, thirty-two have
observed, "that the properties of the plant are evidently soap-orific;"
twenty-eight have opined "that, when Nature planted it in California she
must have had an eye to the gold-washing;" sixty have pronounced
authoritatively, "that the discoverer of the plant ought at once to be
made a Companion of the Bath;" eight have expressed their surprise "that
it should have been discovered by a German, who could have had but
little previous knowledge of the article which it is said to produce;"
whilst the remaining person, an eminent boiler in the City, who prides
himself upon his French accent, remarked that, "they might say it had
been discovered by a German naturalist, but that, for his part, he
should always think it had been found out by a French <i>savon</i>." <i>Mr.
Punch</i> has further ascertained that, in the Californian dialect of
the
language of flowers, this plant signifies "I wash my hands of you!" and
is employed by ladies to intimate their rejection of an unwelcome suit.</p>

<h2>THE CHELSEA GHOST.</h2>

<p>The lovers of the marvellous will be sorry to hear that the Chelsea
Ghost is a spirit raised by the penny-a-liners in the hope of raising
their own spirits by a few extra pence during the present dull season.
We felt quite sure that directly the police went in search of the
apparition, it would not appear to any summons that might be served upon
it; and when we were told that <span class="smcap">Sergeant Somebody</span>
 had walked through the
ghost, we were convinced the real fact must have been that if there was
a ghost at all, the police, instead of walking through it, would have
walked into it. We felt perfectly satisfied that the spectre must vanish
before the inspector, and we are happy, for the sake of common sense, to
find publicity given to the fact, that the Chelsea Ghost lives only in
the imagination of the unhappy paragraph-mongers, who have been tempted
to idealise a spirit for the purpose of realising an extra glass of grog
or some "other compound."</p>

<h2>OUR TOURIST IN PARIS.&#8212;No. 5.</h2>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/126.png" alt="W" class="cap" width="30%" />

<p class="cap_3">WITH that spirit of zealous self-sacrifice which
becomes his office,
your Correspondent has visited the great masqued ball at the Opera, that
terminates the festivities of the Carnival. He was accompanied by the
rising diplomatist <span class="smcap">George Ernest Clarence Protocol</span>,
 whose filmy white
choker, pink shirt, opal studs, and shining boots were truly an honour
to his country. At one o'clock his Brougham whirled us rapidly to the
theatre. The streets were alive with people. A masqued ball is a fête
for those who can't go as well as for those who can. Riotous groups in
costume were exchanging badinage with the crowd and each other as they
converged to the great point of attraction. Flaring gas-lights
illuminated the street down which we turned out of the Boulevard, and
showed to advantage two bearded and cloaked warriors on horseback, who
looked as if they might be part of the entertainment. More flaring
gas-lights, like a butcher's shop on Saturday night; more picturesque
mounted swordsmen&#8212;the Brougham pulls up, and we alight amid the
respectful congratulations of the officials. We mount the stairs in
company of masks, dominoes, and persons in ordinary evening dress, and
pass into the Salle.</p>
</div>

<p>The effect is bewildering, overwhelming. The theatre is open to the
uttermost back wall, and, even so, barely holds the multitude of
dancers. The orchestra is probably the noisiest in the world, but is
nothing to the astounding din of the people. No words can describe the
combination of the two. As for the spectacle, several thousand lunatics,
in the violent stage, capering and gesticulating under a strong paroxysm
of their malady, will present a faint picture of it. The madmen are all
costumed, and resent the appearance of a black coat in their terrific
orgies. Probably it reminds them of the medical gentlemen from whom they
have escaped. There is a sprinkling of Greeks, knights, nobles of <span
class="smcap">Louis
the Thirteenth</span>, shepherdesses, court ladies, and so forth; but
the
prevalent costume of the men is the white and red of a Pierrot; of the
ladies, the chemise and trowsers of a <i>débardeur</i>. It is this
division
that makes the most clamour and has the greatest enjoyment of the fun.
Groups of the white figures with floured faces, tall hats, and streaming
ribbons loll in the boxes, and hold a "chaffing" conversation with those
below, which may be witty, but, at all events, is deafening. The young
ladies in the embroidered shirts, satin pantaloons, and trim hats,
beneath which their hair descends in long plaited tails, contribute at
least their fair share to the uproar. But, besides, there are other
characters not so intelligible. One grotesque shape is composed entirely
of seaweed, or what looks like it; another is in rags, with carrots and
turnips on his head; a third sports a chimney pot as a head dress; a
fourth is surmounted by a weathercock. There is no limit to the
fantastic combinations thus arrived at, which are generally more odd
than pleasant; and any enterprising individual who should make his
appearance in a very dirty shirt, a crownless hat, and a pair of pumps
would, probably, make rather a hit than otherwise.</p>

<p>It must be confessed, after the first half-hour, when the eye is more
accustomed to the scene, and the ear has begun to discriminate between
the various noises, the refined taste of your Correspondent (used to the
assemblies of <span class="smcap">Monsieur Jullien</span>) was very much
 outraged. The orchestra is
simply infamous, nothing being audible but sounding brass and the
jangling cymbal; the house is foully dirty and badly lighted. The
company is shabbily dressed, and, apparently, includes many of the
lowest ruffians of Paris. On the other hand, there is immense enjoyment
and fun, and the dancing made even your travelling sage open the eyes of
astonishment.</p>

<p>The police, of course, are everywhere, and at the ordinary public
balls
interfere to moderate the antics of the dancers. But at the masqued
balls they let things take their course; and the consequence is, that
each lady and gentleman, to the best of her or his ability, indulges in
those variations on the quadrille which are collectively objectionable.
They are, in musical phrase, perfectly <i>ad libitum</i>, and give scope
 for
an exercise of fancy and agility, which would produce rather a sensation
at <span class="smcap">Almacks</span>. There was one couple, <span
class="smcap">Morok</span> the Lion Tamer in red and
hessians, and a <i>débardeur</i> in yellow trowsers and a powdered
peruke,
who really were astounding. <span class="smcap">Morok</span> ended by
carrying off his friend on
his shoulders, to the great delight of a fat Pompier, who stood by in a
bright brass helmet, exactly like a small coalscuttle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Protocol</span> leads the way to the <i>foyer</i>,
 where a totally different scene
presents itself. This saloon is consecrated to persons in evening dress
and dominoes, no costumed characters being admitted. This is the resort
of all the "swells." Of course the blond children of Albion muster
strongly, and, indeed, rather eclipse the native gentlemen with their
severe hauteur and stately presence. Some of the ladies are in ball
dresses, and hang on the arm of cavaliers; the majority are in that
mysterious envelope which recalls <span class="smcap">Auber's</span>
charming comic opera, and
employ themselves in puzzling, or, as they say, "intriguing," whatever
acquaintances they recognise. <span class="smcap">Protocol</span> is
immediately attacked by a tall
black domino, whose eyes sparkle with a lustre no mask can hide. She
whispers something in his ear which heightens his colour, and is gone
before he can demand an explanation. Now, by the shades of <span
class="smcap">Radcliffe</span> and
<span class="smcap">Sir Walter</span>, there is romance in the
nineteenth century! Protocol, you
must practise the guitar and learn a collection of serenades "arranged
to suit a voice of moderate compass." "My dear fellow," replied the
diplomatist, "I thought no one in the world knew what that lovely
creature (I'm sure she's lovely) told me. Just fancy if she should turn
out to be as noble and rich as she is beautiful. Hey?" Ah, <span
class="smcap">Protocol</span>, as
you say, just fancy! Why there she is again. <span class="smcap">Machiavel</span>
 is off in a trice
and pursues the fair who flies from him. The Contemplative One
entertains himself with hearing the adventures of young <span
class="smcap">Tweedles</span>, who
has just joined the Lancers, and is away on a fortnight's leave. The
poor child was induced to present a white domino with about five pounds'
worth of <i>sucre de pommes</i>, which he afterwards saw her resell to
the
Marchand, to his infinite disgust. "You know," complained he, "it ain't
the money I care for, but it's such a howwid baw to be an object of
widicule to a dem Fwenchwoman. They widicule evewy one, and wespect
nothing. No wonder they're always having wevolutions and upsetting
weligion, and all that sort of thing. Let's make up a supper party at
the <i>Café Anglais</i>. You know my cousin <span class="smcap">Swellings
 Swellings</span>, and there's
<span class="smcap">De Faultre</span>, who was in the 20th Black Guards,
 but wesides in Pawis

king. I hope <span class="smcap">Pwotocol</span> will come and bwing his
 fwend."</p>

<p>Another look at the lunatics, who are worse than ever. <span
class="smcap">Morok</span> and the
party in yellow satin trowsers excel themselves. The Cherokees shake
their plumes and howl after a most horrid sort. The Pierrots redouble
their "chaff," and make up in clamour what they want in wit. The
Carnival is on its last legs, and does not spare them. It is still
alive, and kicking. A few hours hence, and those pious persons will be
repenting of their sins on cabbage and onions. Ah! as the lady with the
camellias says, <i>Quelle belle chose que la religion!</i></p>

<p>When Sardis revolted against <span class="smcap">Cyrus</span>, a wise
 captive gave the angry
monarch this advice: "Send men among them to teach them to fiddle and
dance and love pleasure, and they will never more give you any trouble."
I wonder if Paris would revolt now against <span class="smcap">Cyrus</span>.</p>

<p>Supper at the <i>Maison Dorée</i>. A<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span> little <i>consommé</i>
 with poached eggs, a
<i>filet aux champignons</i>, and a salad with a bottle of Champagne.
<span class="smcap">Protocol's</span> acquaintance, it appears, was the <i>blanchisseuse</i>
 of the
Embassy, an exceedingly respectable person of fifty. The rising
diplomatist seemed rather sore on the subject of <i>Le Domino Noir</i>,
which
became the principal topic of conversation in consequence. Of course,
the secret she told him must have been about his washing-bill.</p>

<p>The present opinion of the Sage is, that pleasure, and indeed things
in
general, are vanity. <i>Bals masqués</i> are noisy, dusty, and dull.
People
ought not to pay, but be paid, for going to them. Monastic institutions
have charms for a well-constituted mind. Literary pursuits are laborious
and not sufficiently remunerated. When Champagne is not good, it has
disagreeable effects on your health the next day. Bring me some <i>Cognac</i>
and <i>Eau de Seltz</i>. Oh dear, I wish had cut the supper.</p>

<h2>FRENCH TIES AND DYNAS-TIES.</h2>

<p>The Grand Opéra at Paris has just re-opened, after a perfect
"restoration" made by order of the <span class="smcap">Emperor</span>,
who is more favourable to a
"restoration" in affairs of the drama than in affairs of politics. The
theatre has been gorgeously re-decorated and overlaid with a profusion
of gold, which stands out in all the bold effrontery of gilt beneath the
blaze of a thousand gaslights. Even the members of the orchestra are
elaborately got up, and though not absolutely bound hand and foot at the
will of the <span class="smcap">Emperor</span>, they are literally taken
 by the throat, for they
are compelled to appear in white neckcloths. Every instrumental
performer must become a member of the stiff-necked fraternity if he
wishes to be engaged at the Grand Opéra; and it matters little what may
be his reputation, or how illustrious may be the stock to which he
belongs, if he refuses to bind himself to the tie prescribed by the
French Government. Such is the pliancy with which all classes now bow
their necks to the ruling power, that we have not heard of one instance
in which the forced application of the starched cravat has roused any
artist's choler. It is, however, feared that in a very heavy and
fatiguing opera the time of some of the pieces will have to be changed,
in order that the orchestra may get a few bars' rest to adjust their
neck-ties, which some of the tremendous <i>crescendo</i> movements of
<span class="smcap">Meyerbeer</span> will be likely to derange. We
tremble to think of the
consequences of the "Blessing of the Poignards" on the cravats of the
poor fiddlers.</p>

<h4>Second Thoughts.</h4>

<p>It was intended to inaugurate a statue of <span class="smcap">Louis
Napoleon</span> at Lille,
bearing the inscription&#8212;"To the Protector of Native Sugar." It was,
however, abandoned for re-consideration. It will probably be amended as
follows, and the statue inaugurated on the 2nd of December&#8212;"To the
Protector of Native Sugar&#8212;<i>of lead</i>."</p>

<hr />

<h4>A Joke that must be Felt if it can't be Seen.</h4>

<p>We perceive that all Military Hats are to be superseded in the
British
Army by a "Felt Helmet." We trust this arrangement will prevent
everything but the helmet from being "felt"&#8212;on the head of the soldier.</p>

<h2>BRITISH REASONS FOR BOULOGNE ADDRESS.</h2>

<p>The copy of an address of British residents at Boulogne lay for
signature&#8212;as British residents were duly informed by the
<i>Impartial</i>&#8212;at the library of <span class="smcap">Mrs. Moneydue</span>.
 We have been favoured with
the various reasons&#8212;and subjoin a few&#8212;the exquisite reasons that,
delighting and uplifting the British brain&#8212;induced the British
residents and visitors to write themselves down the very humble and much
obliged servants of the <span class="smcap">Emperor of France</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Alderman Greenfat</span> signed "because he
likes a strong Government. He
also likes success; there is no getting on in this world without it. Has
always believed that the French were only to be ruled with a rod of
iron, and believed that <span class="smcap">Louis Napoleon</span> was
the very man to keep that rod
in pickle."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Shadrach Shekels</span>, money scrivener,
signed "because he would always
support legitimate government. Him as was strongest was always most
legitimate. As a conscientious Jew he didn't care about France, having,
of course, his serious thoughts fixed on settling down in his old age in
New Jerusalem. Didn't think much of <span class="smcap">Louis Napoleon</span>
 when once upon a time
he come into the City of London with his bills: wouldn't look at his
paper at no price. But times is changed. Would do his bill now&#8212;if not
at a <i>very long date</i>&#8212;not only with pleasure, but with great
interest."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Captain Plantagenet Simcox</span> (of the
Stonehenge Yeomanry), signed "because
he liked <span class="smcap">PLUCK</span>. And the <span class="smcap">Emperor</span>
 had shown himself a clever fellow. He
had proved to Europe that he had head beside pluck. Without pluck, who
could have a stake in any country?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor Wobbles</span> signed "because he
considered His Imperial Majesty to
be one of <span class="smcap">Plutarch's</span> men. The <span
class="smcap">Emperor</span> had the true heroic nose. It was a
vulgar error that the world was governed by heads: no; the noses carried
it. Waterloo was won by a nose. The nose is the natural sceptre. The
<span class="smcap">Emperor</span> was born a natural."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John Straight, Esq.</span>, (retired on his
property) signed because "he
thought the <span class="smcap">Emperor</span> so very much improved,
having sown all his wild
oats. Was residing at Boulogne when <span class="smcap">Louis Napoleon</span>
 landed, and was
bundled like a sack of sawdust into a cart and delivered at the prison.
But circumstances being changed, would now with the greatest pleasure
give in his adhesion to the Saviour and Protector of France!"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Deputy Botolph</span> would sign "because
the dear <span class="smcap">Emperor</span> had asked
herself and <span class="smcap">Jemima</span> to the ball at the
Tooleries; besides, His Majesty
looked such a hero upon horseback."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Agnes Bochurch</span> signed "with a sense
of gratitude to the dear
<span class="smcap">Empress</span>, who had brought in such a darling
style of dressing the hair."
Miss <span class="smcap">A. B.</span> was, when in Paris, <i>once</i>
taken for the <span class="smcap">Empress</span>.</p>

<hr />

<h2>THE FAT OF THE LAND AND LAMBETH.</h2>

<p>One <span class="smcap">Mr. Rhodes</span>, of Carlisle Street,
Lambeth, is summoned before the
Lambeth Street Magistrate to answer for the&#8212;what shall we call
it&#8212;indiscretion (?) of boiling down putrid fat on his premises to the
prejudice of the health of his neighbours, causing thereby "nausea, and
even vomiting." <span class="smcap">Mr. Secker</span> turns to the
wisdom of Parliament enshrined
in the Nuisance Act, but found that&#8212;</p>

<blockquote><p>"The words relating to any dwelling-house or building
being found in
a filthy and unwholesome condition <i>applied not</i>, as he took it, to
places where <i>a trade or business was carried on</i>, but to common
lodging-houses and places of that description, and the other part of
the clause <i>did not apply to the premises described</i>."</p></blockquote>

<p>That is, if you can make a trade of a nuisance, if you can "carry on a
business" by fat-melting, the evil to the public is to be allowed
because of the profit to the individual. You may turn a whole parish
sick, if you can turn the penny upon their "nausea and vomiting."</p>

<hr />

<h2>EDITORIAL CANDOUR.</h2>

<p>The <i>Morning Herald</i> has recently made an approach to the
principle of
abolishing the anonymous in newspaper writing, and has made a sort of
indirect disclosure of its editorship, by meeting the public half-way in
authorising an impression that has long existed in the minds of the
community. The <i>Herald</i> of Tuesday, the 20th of September, after
saying,
"<i>we</i> have been favoured with the following letter," prints a
communication beginning "My dear Mamma." It is clear that to have made
the avowal of its severally imputed editorship complete, the letter
should have commenced with the words, "My dear Grandmamma."</p>

<hr />

<h4>The Russian Bear and the Turkey Cock.</h4>

<p>We have heard a good deal lately about the "position taken by
Turkey;"
and as the attitude assumed has been undoubtedly rather warlike, we may
come to the conclusion that the "position taken by Turkey" is in fact
standing on her drum-sticks.</p>

<h2>ALARMING ACCIDENT.</h2>

<center>(<i>From our Own Four-Mil-a-Liner</i>)</center>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/128.png" alt="M" class="cap" width="50%" />

<p class="cap_3">MIRACULOUS escape&#8212;Another of those distressing
accidents which too
often lead to a melancholy catastrophe took place on Wednesday evening
last. A party of four adventurous gentlemen, who had resolved on
visiting the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, after a quiet dinner at their
club, proceeded to that edifice, and, under the direction of a guide,
actually penetrated the labyrinths to the lowest box on the opposite
side from that at which they entered. Having achieved this feat, and
feasted their eyes upon the scenery thus set before them, one of them
announced his intention of attempting to get out of the theatre alone.
His companions sought to dissuade him from this foolhardy exploit; but,
flushed, it is supposed, with an extra half-pint of St. Estephe, the
traveller, a remarkably fine young man, to whom his friends were not in
the least attached, departed on the perilous enterprise. He ascended
eleven staircases, descended fourteen, and, having gone backwards and
forwards through twenty-two of the passages which come from nowhere and
lead to nothing, in this most wonderfully constructed building, he made
the appalling discovery that he had lost his way.</p>
</div>

<p>With the true Anglo-Saxon courage, he continued to explore
undauntedly,
and at one period went down deep into the bowels of the earth, where,
far above his head, he could distinctly hear the trampling of feet, and
where, in the darkness, he stumbled upon certain whitish objects which
may have been either the skeletons of other lost travellers, or else
property busts and statues. At length, overcome by terror and thirst, he
rushed upwards, and continued to mount until he reached the dizzy height
where the air was so intensely rarified as to smell of oranges and
gingerbeer, and where, he states, he could distinctly hear the voice of
<span class="smcap">Mr. Gustavus Brooke</span> recommending <span
class="smcap">Miss Featherstone</span> to go to a nunnery.
His sufferings at this period were most acute, and his despairing
efforts to open every door he saw were agonizing.</p>

<p>Retracing his steps, he explored every lonely passage, dusty avenue,
and
dark staircase in vain, and finally he conceived the daring resolution
of setting the theatre on fire, in the hope that assistance might thus
be summoned, but was prevented by the want of material. At one time he
says that he heard female voices, and immediately addressed to the
speaker those imploring accents to which woman never listens unmoved;
but his words were flung back to him by the echoes with an injurious
addition of something sounding like "Tipsy, I suppose." At last, fairly
overcome, he sat down upon an extremely dirty couch, and resigned
himself to his fate. How many dreadful hours thus passed he knows not,
but on returning to consciousness he found himself among kind faces, and
being carried over to the nearest tavern he was subjected to a course of
restoratives, including alcohol and nicotine, and was finally able to
walk home with some straightness. It is hoped that this will be a
warning, and inasmuch as proper guides can always be obtained for a
shilling, there is really no excuse for running so terrible a risk as
that of trying to leave the private boxes of Drury Lane without
assistance.</p>

<hr />

<h2>THE POPE'S POST OBIT.</h2>

<p>In the <i>Giornale di Roma</i>, of the 25th ultimo, appears a
document called
the "Act of Beatification" of <span class="smcap">Father John</span> of
Britto, a Jesuit, who
suffered martyrdom in 1693; so that, after the lapse of 160 years, <span
 class="smcap">His
Holiness the Pope</span> has "beatified" the martyred Jesuit&#8212;made <span
class="smcap">Father John</span>
happy at last. The Holy See is really as dilatory in beatifying parties,
or making them happy, as the High Court of Chancery. The Church of Rome
treats saints as some other churchmen treat bottles of port&#8212;laying them
down to acquire the right flavour, as well as <i>bouquet</i>,
notwithstanding
that the latter ought to have been already possessed by individuals who
had died in the odour of sanctity. Miracles, we believe, are necessary
to canonization; no miracles, no Saintship: no niche in the calendar.
Our ultra-montane friends tell us that miracles, "the apparition of <span
 class="smcap">La
Salette</span>" for instance, are rigidly investigated at Rome; but it
must be
difficult to sift those which occurred above 160 years ago, unless the
witnesses are cross-examined by table-rapping, or some equivalent means
of communicating with the defunct. However, the case of <span
class="smcap">Father John</span> may
teach those whom it may concern not to be disheartened by the delay of
their beatification by the Roman Pontiffs, by showing them that though
they may have had to wait more than a century and a half for their
beatitude, they "may be happy yet."</p>

<hr />

<h4>A Proverb at Fault.</h4>

<p>Proverbial philosophy will occasionally fail, and we need go no
further
for an instance than the well known maxim as to the propriety of "a long
pull, a strong pull, and a pull all together." Take six hearty
coalheavers, and, putting between them a pot of porter, call upon them
to take "a long pull and a strong pull," if you please; but pause before
you invite them to the impracticable operation of "a pull all together."</p>

<h2>A NEW DEPARTMENT OF FLUNKEYISM.</h2>

<p>One of our contemporaries&#8212;the <i>Observer</i>&#8212;not satisfied with
registering the mere dinner-givings, <i>déjeûners</i>, migrations, and
marriages of the "upper classes," has just started a new department, to
which the rather alarming title of "Accidents in High Life" has been
given. We are henceforth, it seems, to be treated to the details of
aristocratic mishaps, and the public press is to inform us how <span
class="smcap">Lord Tom
Noddy</span> tumbled into a ditch while hunting, or what slips have been
 made
by <span class="smcap">Lady So-and-So</span>. We presume we may
anticipate, under the thrilling
title of "Accidents in High Life," a few such paragraphs as the
following:&#8212;</p>

<p>"We regret to hear of a rather uncomfortable casualty having occurred
 to
the young <span class="smcap">Earl of Spoonbill</span>. His lordship,
while riding in Piccadilly,
had the misfortune to run over a young miscreant who was carrying a
basket of oranges. The young nobleman was somewhat shaken by the
concussion, which it is understood was sufficiently violent to break the
legs of the unhappy wretch who was the cause of it; but, as we ran by
the side of his lordship's horse, to be able to give our readers the
latest particulars of his health, we did not wait to hear the fate of
the degraded creature, who is, we hope, by this time expiating in a jail
the offence of obstructing a thoroughfare and causing a temporary
agitation to a member of a noble family. Repeated inquiries at his
lordship's area-gate have satisfied us that there is no further cause
for alarm. The noble earl was attended by the family apothecary, who
"exhibited" a Sedlitz powder over night, and beef tea in the morning.</p>

<h4>Glut of Money at the Museum.</h4>

<p>A complaint has been made against the Trustees of the British Museum,
that they keep hoarded up several hundreds of duplicate coins, which
might be sold or otherwise advantageously disposed of. It certainly does
appear at first sight rather useless to keep several hundred pieces of
money of the same sort; but perhaps the Trustees think it would not be
prudent to leave themselves without one shilling or penny, as the case
may be, to rub against another.</p>

<h2>INFALLIBLE BUBBLES.</h2>

<center>(<i>To Mr. Punch.</i>)</center>

<p class="salute">"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>"Although yours is not a medical journal, I am sure you will readily
give insertion to a few lines, which may be rendered, by means of your
enormous circulation, instrumental in the preservation of thousands of
lives. Cases of recent occurrence have fearfully exemplified the
fact&#8212;previously well enough established&#8212;of the dependence of Asiatic
Cholera, in common with Typhus and other pestilences, on the inhalation
of the gaseous products of putrefactive decomposition. These consist
principally of sulphuretted hydrogen; indeed that gas is, there can be
no doubt, the noxious agent. Now, Sir, I wish to direct public attention
to an infallible preventive of Cholera, and every other disease of
zymotic origin, which, in the form of an antidote against the gas that
occasions them, is presented to us by Hom&oelig;opathy. You know that the
cardinal doctrine of that science is that <i>similia similibus curantur</i>;
like cures like. Well, Sir; there is a gaseous compound analogous to, or
like, sulphuretted hydrogen: I mean seleniuretted hydrogen, also called
hydro-selenic acid. The inhalation of a measure of atmospheric air,
otherwise pure, containing one part in ten billions of this gas, will
secure any individual whatever against both Cholera, and the whole class
of affections resulting from the same cause.</p>

<p>"Observe, only, that in order that the remedy may be enabled to act
all
impediments to its operation must be carefully removed. Sulphuretted
hydrogen must cease to be breathed. The drainage of the neighbourhood
should be rendered efficient; all the sewers should be flushed and
trapped; all the cesspools stopped; all the graveyards closed; all the
knackers' yards, bone-boilers', and catgut makers' establishments and
every other description of nuisance in the neighbourhood abated.</p>

<p>"No other subsidiary conditions are requisite, except personal
ablution,
wholesome food, and abstinence from intoxicating quantities of gin, and
other alcoholic fluids."</p>

<h2>THE AGE OF COMPLIMENTS.</h2>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/129b.png" alt="S" class="cap" width="30%" />

<p class="cap_3">SEEMINGLY everybody is getting so very polite to
everybody else that it
is beginning to be almost impossible for two or three persons to get
together without a meeting of two being got up to present the third with
a testimonial. If a steam-boat goes on a rather lengthy voyage, there is
sure to be a party mustered to pass flattering resolutions expressive of
confidence in the captain, although the ship may have gone several
hundred miles out of its way, and there may have been a variety of other
disagreeable <i>contretemps</i>.</p>

<p>The absurdity of testimonial-giving has reached such a height that we
may expect it to go still higher before it finally topples over, and we
shall not be astonished to hear that two persons riding together in a
Hansom cab have formed themselves into a meeting for the purpose of
presenting the driver with a new lash to his whip, or some other
appropriate "testimonial." When we hear of votes of thanks having been
passed in favour of the commander of a steamer across the Atlantic, we
feel that the difficult navigation of the Thames would warrant the
presentation of a piece of plate&#8212;say a toothpick&#8212;to the captains of
the Penny <i>Pink</i> or the Halfpenny <i>Bee</i>, or the twopenny <i>Citizen</i>.
 If
steam-boat passengers are to come to complimentary votes, what reason
can there be why omnibus passengers should not vote one of their body
into the chair, and record a series of resolutions in honour of the
driver for his able and impartial conduct on the driving seat, or the
conductor for his uprightness on his foot-board?</p>

<h2>PRISON DISCIPLINARIANS.</h2>

<center>"Who shall decide when jailors disagree?"</center>

<h4>Extract from the Evidence taken before the last Parliamentary
Committee
on the Subject of Prison Discipline.</h4>

<center><span class="smcap">Captain Fondleprig's</span> <i>Examination</i>.</center>

<p><i>Q. 3491.</i> <i>Chairman.</i> You have had considerable experience
 in the
treatment of felons and other prisoners, and have made prison discipline
the object of much consideration?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> I have.</p>

<p><i>Q. 3492.</i> Will you give the Committee your ideas of the mode in
 which
prisoners should be treated.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> I recommend the utmost kindness and indulgence. The
criminal should
excite our compassion, and we should do our utmost to alleviate his
sense of the punishment which society makes it necessary to inflict. I
would, on his arrival, ascertain, delicately of course, what had been
his previous habits and tastes. If he could read, which I would discover
by some little stratagem (such as placing a letter in his hand and
asking him what <i>he</i> made of the address, as it puzzled <i>me</i>,
or some
other gentle device), I would cause amusing books to be placed, during
the night, in his cell, and secretly changed, so as not to put him under
obligation. If he could not read, poor fellow, I, or my wife, or my
daughter, should read to him whenever he chose to ring for us, and I
would accord him the indulgence of a pipe, if he wished it. To civilise
and lead him to the Beautiful, fresh flowers should be placed in his
cell&#8212;we would, in naming it to him, call it his grot&#8212;every morning,
and I would recommend the hanging his apartment with engravings from the
best masters, avoiding of course any subject likely to remind him
painfully of his incarceration. Music should be supplied, and I have a
plan for bringing all the Italian organists where I believe most people
wish they were, namely, within the walls of our gaols, to soothe the
minds of our captives. The bath should be recommended to, but not forced
upon him, and if he preferred a warm bath in his cell, with Eau de
Cologne in the water, I should naturally order it. For his health's
sake, I should advise his adhering to the regular hours of meals, but if
he desired a glass of sherry and a sponge cake, or an ice and wafers, or
oysters and stout, between meals it would be inhuman to refuse it. The
bill of fare should be brought to him each morning, and any reasonable
suggestions he might make for its alteration he should see were attended
to. If, which I do not anticipate, he should, despite this treatment, be
insubordinate, I would, after long, patient, and humble entreaty had
been exhausted, threaten to withhold his ice, or withdraw his flowers,
or, in a very bad case, I might refuse him Eau de Cologne to his bath.</p>

<p><i>Q. 3493.</i> If a prisoner were very rebellious, would you whip
him?</p>

<p><i>The Witness fainted, and was removed.</i></p>

<center><span class="smcap">Lieutenant Skinnum's</span> <i>Examination</i>.</center>

<p><i>Q. 3494.</i> <i>Chairman.</i> You have had considerable experience
 in the
treatment of felons and other prisoners, and have made prison discipline
the object of much consideration?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> I have.</p>

<p><i>Q. 3495.</i> Will you give the Committee your ideas of the mode in
 which
prisoners should be treated?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Treated! I'd treat 'em, bless 'em. Shady side of a deuced
good
bamboo's the place for them. Confound them! Why, if a fellow's sent to
jail, stands to reason he's a scoundrel, and if he's a scoundrel treat
him as such. It's an insult to an honest man to leave a rogue with a
whole bone in his skin. My way's short. Thrash a rascal whenever you
happen to be near him, and have a stick handy, which I take care
generally to have; but a poker will do, or a crowbar, if you're in a
hurry. The object of punishment is to prevent the offence being
repeated, and dash my buttons but a fellow will think twice before he
commits an offence that gets him under my hands a second time. Boys?
Why, boys are worse than men. A man steals, perhaps, to feed his family;
but what does a blessed boy steal for? To buy tarts and gin, and go to
the penny theatre. I take it out of 'em, though. First I thrash 'em till
there isn't a bit of their system that can be called strictly
comfortable. Next, I starve 'em till they're as weak as rats. Then I
give 'em work to do which they could hardly do if they were in the
strongest health, and if they drop down at it I lick 'em till they get
up again, and I refresh their minds with pails of cold water into the
bargain. That's the right system. Ever kill them? Well, not often.
Sometimes they die out of spite, for these boys are very malicious and
revengeful, and will do anything to get an officer into trouble; but I
find the magistrates baffle their malignity by taking no notice, and all
goes on well. As for insubordination, by Jove, they don't often try it
with me, but an iron collar, and a chain to hold it to the wall, a taste
of the cat o' nine tails after Morning and Evening Service, a sound kick
whenever a jailor happens to pass, and food placed before the rascal,
but just out of his reach, for a few days, do wonders.</p>

<p><i>Q. 3496.</i> If a prisoner were very rebellious, would you whip
him?</p>

<p><i>Witness, (in a dreadful rage).</i> Whip him, Sir! No, Sir!
Whipping's too
good for him, Sir! I'd&#8212;I'd&#8212;I'd&#8212;skin him alive, Sir&#8212;that's what I'd
do with him, Sir.</p>

<p>[<i>The witness, in his excitement, knocked over the short-hand
writer
with a violent back-hander, and rushed out.</i></p>

<h4>The Weapons of the Slave.</h4>

<p>At Wilkesbarre, in Pennsylvania, two slave-hunters under the Fugitive
Slave Law did their best and worst to recapture a mulatto, named <span
class="smcap">Rex</span>.
They placed handcuffs on him; but with these very handcuffs, the
man&#8212;maddened by despair&#8212;beat down and marked his hunters. There is a
moral in this, if America could understand it. Well will it be if
emancipation be granted before slavery, with its very chains, shall
knock down and mark the national slaveholders.</p>

<h2>THE CROWN OF HUNGARY.</h2>

<p>It seems that the Royal Insignia of Hungary have lately been dug out of
a hole in a very damaged condition. The Crown was cracked, and the cloak
of <span class="smcap">St. Stephen</span>, which, if it had been "made to measure" for the Saint
himself, must have been rather the worse for wear, was so injured by
damp that if <span class="smcap">St. Stephen's</span> mantle should fall on anybody else the result
could only be rheumatism. The garment cannot, however, have been worth
much, for if it was the cloak that the Hungarian royalty used to wear,
it had long ago become transparent, and might have been seen through
very easily. We have not heard how the rubbish came to be discovered;
but as the cloak was very seedy it may have sprung up, as anything of a
seedy nature is apt to do when buried in the ground, and thus given a
clue to its own discovery. Who got the Crown into the mess in which it
was found is not a question very difficult of solution; but it is clear
that those who imputed its abstraction to <span class="smcap">M. Kossuth</span>, were as much in
the dark as many of the acts and deeds of the Austrian Government. When
a Crown is dragged in the dirt and degraded, the probability is, that he
whom the cap fits is the one whose head it ought to rest upon.</p>

<hr />

<h2>A WORD FOR THE HOTEL-KEEPERS.</h2>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/132a.png" alt="S" class="cap" width="30%" />

<p class="cap_3">SEVERAL correspondents of the <i>Times</i> have been
writing themselves into
a great rage lately, about what they are pleased to call the "Iniquity
of our present Hotel system." They complain, with a warmth of expression
which is really very seasonable, that go where you will throughout the
kingdom, you'll not find an Inn which is not inn-convenient&#8212;to your
person, certainly, if not to your purse. Everywhere, they say, you'll be
charged a good price for bad accommodation: and the larger the
establishment, the smaller is your chance of escaping imposition. If you
order a light dinner, you may be sure, nevertheless, you'll have to pay
a heavy price for it. If wine be your beverage, you'll be charged three
and sixpence for a glass and a half of Cape, served in a vinegar-cruet
and called "a pint of Sherry:" or, if you drink beer, you will get a jug
of what it were a bitter raillery to call bitter ale, and which, however
nasty, you'll be charged a nice sum for. So that, in either case, the
process of selling these liquids may be said invariably to include the
purchaser. Your candles, too, they say, which figure so highly as "wax"
in the bill, will prove in the candlestick to be as bad a composition as
the fourpence in the pound of a fraudulent bankrupt: and whether lit or
not, there's still the burning shame that you're to pay just the same
for them. For "attendance," too, you are charged about as much as for a
lawyer's: half-a-crown a day being no uncommon item for the luxury of
sometimes looking at a waiter. And if you want a horse, you'll find
there's not one in the stable but what's made a heavy charger.</p>
</div>

<p>Another of their complaints is, that in the fitting up of our hotels
there is as much bad taste as in the wines you cannot drink there. For,
while the second-class houses are barely half-furnished, those which are
anomalously styled "first-rate" are as much over-done as the victims who
frequent them, all the rooms being crammed to every corner with a lot of
ugly furniture, for which nevertheless you've to pay pretty handsomely.</p>

<p>In short, the British Innkeeper, as these writers represent him,
figures
as a sort of human apteryx, who supports himself entirely by the length
of his bill.</p>

<p>Now, the correctness of these charges we admit as readily as we
dispute
the landlords'. At the same time, we think there is an evident excuse
for them; for the writers, in their vehemence, seem entirely to have
overlooked the fact, that inasmuch as every innkeeper is bound to keep
open house, he is obviously obliged to take as many people in as
possible.</p>

<h2>A LITTLE MONEY QUESTION.</h2>

<p class="salute">"<span class="smcap">Oh, dear Punch, dear,</span></p>

<p>"I want to ask you one little question. It is about 'defacing the
coin.'
I wish to ask whether my brother <span class="smcap">Septimus</span> is
liable to be taken up? The
foolish boy has several waistcoats, the buttons of which are made of
coins. He has one for every-day use made with fourpenny pieces. He has
another, the buttons of which are made with half-sovereigns. That is for
Sunday wear, whilst he has another for very grand occasions that is
buttoned together with two-sovereign pieces. He is with these absurd
fancies quite a 'Man made of Money', and I know a young lady who calls
him a 'walking change for a ten-pound note.' It is very conceited of him
to be sure, and I am only afraid he will be taken up some
day&#8212;especially if he has on at the time his great driving coat that has
a long row of half-crowns running down in front, and a couple of
crown-pieces over the pockets behind. Now I wish you to tell me, dear
<i>Punch</i>, supposing he is taken up, can they send him to prison, and
 cut
his hair off, and make him eat gruel for defacing the coin? I am more
frightened than I can tell you about him.</p>

<p>"Poor fellow! It would be terrible to see two big policemen lay their
large hands on him, when he was out walking with his little sister, and
tear him away from my side, because he happened to be wearing his grand
pink shirt with the studs made out of the tiniest threepenny pieces.
This talk about 'defacing the coin' is all rubbish, for it strikes me
that if I give ten shillings for half-a-sovereign, I have a right to do
what I like with it&#8212;to throw it in the fire even, if I choose; but I am
fairly tired out of my life with such stuff!</p>

<p class="regards">I remain, my dearest <i>Punch</i>,</p>
<p class="author">Your great friend and admirer,</p>
<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Clara</span> (at No. 10).</p>

<p>"P.S. Supposing again I choose to wear a lucky coin round my neck
that
was given to me by <span class="smcap">Julius</span> before he went to
sea, I should like to know
what they would do with me? I declare <i>I would die sooner</i> than
they
should take it from me!"</p>

<h2>LE GRAND OPERA ENRHUMÉ.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">M. Halévy</span>, weary of compelling his
orchestra to imitate the tinkling of
Bayadères' armlets, or the solemn tramp of an army of elephants, has, in
his opera of the <i>Nabob</i>, now performing at the Opéra Comique,
introduced a novel musical effect, upon which <i>Mr. Punch</i>, in
anticipation of its speedy transmission to England, feels bound to offer
a word of comment. In the third act of the opera, the libretto of which,
be it remarked, is from the pen of <span class="smcap">M. Scribe</span>,
 a chaise, containing two
of the principal characters, is upset at the door of a tobacconist's
shop in Wales. Of course, the occupants of the chaise are assisted into
the shop, where they sing a duet with, as the French papers say, "A
funny accompaniment of coughing and sneezing." At this we are told the
whole house <i>"éclata de rire</i>", and that "<i>les brouhahas les plus
 vives
accueillirent ce joli morçeau</i>". If <i>Mr. Punch</i> were not
entirely free
from all petty national jealousy, he might, perhaps, insinuate that <span
 class="smcap">M.
Halévy</span> has taken his idea from the brilliant sternutations which
the
immortal tenor <span class="smcap">Grimaldi</span> was wont to
embroider, as the <i>Morning Post</i>
would say, upon his grand scena of "<i>Tippetywitchet</i>." But he
contents
himself with <span class="smcap">M. Halévy's</span> indirect tribute of
praise to that great
<i>artiste</i>, and rejoices in the conviction that the <i>belle
fioriture</i> of
<i>il povero Guiseppe</i>, now that they have received the stamp of
French
approval, will come into general acceptation with us.</p>

<p>He expects that during the ensuing winter great pains will be taken
to
perforate the roofs and walls of our theatres, as managers will feel
that no singer can succeed properly in an air unless she stands in a
draught.</p>

<p>He expects also that his contemporaries will criticise the <i>début</i>
 of a
new tenor after the following fashion&#8212;</p>

<blockquote><p>"<span class="smcap">Signor Infreddatura</span>, who made
 his first appearance last night in
the comic opera of <i>Il Catarro</i>, has all the qualifications of a
great singer; viz. a fine person, a sweet and powerful voice,
expressive and appropriate action, and <i>a bad cold</i>. He took all
his
sternutations with the greatest ease, and in correct time, and in
his grand aria of '<i>Ah! tu traditrice</i>,' the audience knew not
whether to admire most, the great power with which he gave the
<i>Ahchew</i>&#8212;sustaining the '<i>Ah</i>' for some seconds, and then
suddenly
pouring forth the '<i>Chew</i>' in a volume of sound that <span
class="smcap">Duprez</span> might
have envied&#8212;or the playful irony which he threw into his new and
<i>spirituel</i> reading of the <i>treechay</i>. He was, however, but
badly
seconded by <span class="smcap">Madame Testachiara</span>, who was so
nervous as to have no
control over her organ whatever, so that the two pinches of snuff
which the prompter administered to her before she came on exploded
at the wrong time, and thus impaired the general effect of an
otherwise fine performance."</p></blockquote>

<p>One advantage <i>Mr. Punch</i> perceives, will certainly result from
the
vigorous prosecution of <span class="smcap">M. Halévy's</span> idea. It
is that, whereas our
climate has hitherto been the bane, it will henceforth prove the
antidote of foreign singers. They will flock here in crowds to perfect
their education, nor will they be deterred from coming by a fear of
overstocking the market, as they will always feel sure that there is
plenty of rheum for them in England. And even <span class="smcap">Mr.
Sims Reeves</span>, when
afflicted by the recurrence of his apparently hereditary cold, need no
longer disappoint the audience by withdrawing from them altogether, and
may favour them with "My lodging is on the cold ground" (a song which
will naturally afford great scope for a display of the new ornaments),
or with "We'll sound the gay Catarrh."</p>

<hr />

<h2>OBSTRUCTING THE PAVEMENT.</h2>

<p>A poor applewoman is not allowed to loiter on the pavement. The
lithographic artist, who draws the reddest salmon and setting suns on
the flagstones, is instantly told by the policeman to "walk his chalks."
The broken-down tradesman, with his white neckcloth, and black gloves
with the fingers peeping out of the tips, is not allowed to lean against
a door-post, and offer, in a melancholy attitude, his lucifer-matches
for sale. The same rigour is exercised towards the hundred-bladed Jew
boy, the barefooted girl with her bunch of violets, and the grinning
Italian with his organ. Not one of them is allowed to monopolise the
pavement, but is immediately commanded by the ferocious policeman to
"move on." But there is a class of persons who are permitted to remain
still, where a child who is crying her apples "three a penny" is not
allowed even to loiter. This class of persons is not the most reputable
class to come in contact with, nor the pleasantest even to look at. It
is the betting class. Pass a betting-shop when you will, you are sure to
find an immense crowd collected outside it.</p>

<p>There is no knowing what they talk about&#8212;and we have not the
slightest
wish to increase our knowledge&#8212;but there they will stand for hours,
running in and out of the shop, in the most feverish state, exchanging
memoranda in half-whispers, and dotting down incomprehensible figures in
little clasp-books, which they hold up close to their breasts, for fear
any one should see what they are inscribing in them. They seem
dreadfully afraid lest any one should peep over their shoulders, and
discover the wonderful "odds" they are pencilling down. We have no
particular love or partiality for this numerous class of <span
class="smcap">Her Majesty's</span>
subjects. We do not like them, with their slangy stable coats, their
sporting hats knowingly cocked on one side, and their suspicious looks
that seem to say of every one on whom their sharp, calculating glances
fall, "Well, I wonder how green you are, and I wonder what harvest I
shall get out of your greenness." We do not like this betting <i>genus</i>,
with its whips and switchy canes, and thick-ruled trowsers, into which a
small five-barred gate seems to have been compressed, and its sensual
thick-lipped mouths, that are invariably playing with a flower or a
piece of straw, or caressing the end of a pencil.</p>

<p>Now, this class of persons blocks up our public pavements. Attempt to
pass by the Haymarket, or Jermyn Street, or the purlieus of Leicester
Square, about four or five o'clock, and you will find that the arteries
of circulation are tied up by those thick coagulated knots of betting
men. The thoroughfare is quite impassable, and you are compelled to go
into the mud of the road to avoid being soiled by the refuse of the
pavement. We wish the police would, until the entire system is
abolished, sweep away the offensive nuisance, for we do not see why
betting men should be allowed to carry on their trade on the flagstones
any more than applewomen, or even your openly-professed beggar. The
police might be worse engaged than in making them "move on." In this
instance we would have them not pay the slightest respect to their
"betters."</p>

<h2>"THE BONES OF PAGANINI."</h2>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/133.png" alt="A" class="cap" width="15%" />

<p class="cap_3">A paragraph with the above startling heading has been going the round
 of
the newspapers. It seems that the bones of the great violinist have been
turned into bones of contention, by the priests who have refused to bury
them. Several lawsuits have taken place, and there has been one appeal
to the Court of Nice, which treated the matter as a Nice question. This
court refused the request of <span class="smcap">Paganini's</span>
executors, who were anxious to
get the bones buried; but rather than submit to the decree, without
making any further bones about the matter, they appealed to Genoa, which
it seems is somewhat over nice, for it superseded Nice in its decision.
A further appeal has, however, been made to Turin, which reversed the
judgment of Genoa, and a reference to the Holy See is now spoken of.
"There the matter rests," say the papers, but where the bones will
ultimately rest remains a problem.</p>

<h2>THAT VERY SMALL (POLITICAL) PARTY.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord John Russell</span>, in his recent speech at
 Greenock, alluded to the
"absence of party" as a thing scarcely to be hoped, but greatly to be
desired. The word "party" is so vague in its ordinary sense, that we
should be glad to know the "party" to which <span class="smcap">Lord
John</span> alludes. He may
either mean "that party" over the way, on the other side of the House,
or that "other party," or that "Irish party," or that "troublesome
little party" that is always asking inconvenient questions, or some
"party" that some other "party" is always egging on to annoy the
Government. The only "party" to which we are quite sure his Lordship did
not refer is the "Protectionist party," for it would have been absurd to
express a wish for the absence of what has already ceased to be, and it
would be even worse than crushing a butterfly on a wheel, to call for
the annihilation of a nonentity.</p>

<h2>THE LANDLORDS' MEETING AT THE LONDON COFFEE HOUSE.</h2>

<p>Some of our daily contemporaries have published an advertisement,
headed, "<span class="smcap">The Times</span> <i>versus</i> <span
class="smcap">English Hotels</span>," and consisting of six
resolutions passed at a meeting of the principal Hotel-keepers of Town
and Country, held at the London Coffee House, Ludgate Hill, on the 15th
instant.</p>

<p>What end the public-house-keepers proposed to themselves in
publishing
those resolutions, it is not very easy to conceive. A mere resolution
that a newspaper, in criticising hotel prices, has abused the liberty of
the Press, will not persuade any reader of the paper to think so. The
worst thing that has been, or could have been done to the landlords by a
newspaper, was the publication of their bills: do they resolve this to
be exceeding the bounds of just criticism?</p>

<p>Unnecessary wax-lights, at 2<i>s.</i> a pair; port and sherry fifty
per cent.
above market price; swipes calling itself ale, at 1s. per pot; these and
all such items, if obviously extortionate, cannot be exhibited in any
other light by the simple resolution of the extortioners, even if that
be framed and glazed.</p>

<p>There is just one use which we may imagine these ostensible
resolutions
to serve. Perhaps they are put forward by way of blind to the real ones
which were formed at this assembly of publicans. The following,
probably, are those which the gentlemen actually concurred in:&#8212;</p>

<p class="salute">Resolved, unanimously&#8212;</p>

<p>I. That an agitation has been raised against hotel charges by the
Press,
which, if unchecked, will perhaps result in the reduction of them, by
terrifying some of us into diminishing our prices, and necessitating the
rest to follow their example.</p>

<p>II. That it is our interest to resist the attempt thus being made to
compel us, by intimidation, to moderate our bills.</p>

<p>III. That such resistance can be effectually maintained only by a
firm
combination amongst ourselves, based upon a determination to stand by
each other, in the endeavour to perpetuate those exactions which we now
levy on the British Public; but that by hanging closely together, we may
defy the Press, hold the public at our mercy, and safely despise and
disregard popular opinion.</p>

<p>IV. But that, in order to preserve this happy state of independence,
it
is indispensably necessary to exclude most rigorously from the
Hotel-keeping business the pernicious principle of competition.</p>

<p>V. That every effect and exertion should therefore be made to induce
the
Magistrates in town and country to persevere in their existing excellent
system of restricting tavern-licenses to certain parties; thereby
restraining that competition which would soon oblige us to adjust our
prices in conformity with the clamour of common sense.</p>

<p>VI. That a subscription be entered into in order to raise funds for
the
further propitiation of the said Magistrates in our favour, by bribing
them additionally to persist in refusing licenses to any other
individuals than ourselves.</p>

<hr />

<h2>SHAMEFUL INTIMIDATION OF AN OLD GENTLEMAN.</h2>

<p>At the Westminster Police Office, in the course of an organ-grinding
nuisance case, there was read, according to the reports, a threatening
letter; which, as the following copy of it will show, was of a very
dangerous character. It was stated to have been addressed to "an aged
invalid gentleman;" who, we presume, had disobliged the writers by
growling at them and sending them away:&#8212;</p>

<blockquote><p>"<span class="smcap">Signor Russell</span>,&#8212;You are one
very great vicked ole man. You are one
very rechted miserable man. Why you wil hart the pore horgan man
that trys to get a honnest living, for you have plenty yourself
money? Why you stop the poor horgan man to get a little money? You
are a very ole feeble man, and cannot life much longer. When you die
where will your guilty sole go to? You have no charity for the poor
horgan man; what charity will God have for you in the next world?
What mercy will he have for you? He will be as hard to you in the
next world as you are to the poor man in this. You will go to
purgatory and stop for ever and ever, if you do not repent of your
vickidnys, you brown breeched, blue coated, brite button ole
scarecrow; now, in conclusion, three or four of us true sons of
Italy have sworn by the <span class="smcap">Holy Virgin</span> to make
of you rite over upon
the top of your own dore-steps one fritefullest tomartyr.</p></blockquote>

<p class="regards">
"Sined,<br />
"<span class="smcap">Antonio G.</span><br />
"<span class="smcap">Guido R.</span><br />
"<span class="smcap">Juan B.</span>"<br />
</p>

<p>The report further states that opposite the names were three daggers;
but from the theological views apparent on the face of the document, we
imagine that the daggers were merely the sort of index which his
Eminence <span class="smcap">Cardinal Wiseman</span> is in the habit of
prefixing to his signature.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Broderip</span>, we are told, read this
letter, "which created much
laughter." Of that convulsive affection, however, happily nobody died;
so that the communication was simply dangerous&#8212;not actually fatal to
the hearers. To the original recipient, however, it seems to have been
productive of consequences seriously alarming, as it, "had put him into
such a state of bodily fear that he was nearly dead."</p>

<p>We have read of people who saw their own ghosts; which rather
frightened
them. <span class="smcap">Signor Russell</span>, perhaps, was in some
degree terrified by his own
phantom, raised by the Italian organ-grinders&#8212;the apparition of himself
in brown breeches, blue coat, and brass buttons. However, besides being
thus exhibited as an "old scarecrow" to his own eyes, he had cause for
apprehension in one of the mysterious menaces addressed to him. The
threat of perpetual Purgatory, a Protestant old gentleman might despise;
but that of martyrdom by being made the frightfullest tomartyr upon the
top of his own door steps, is a substantial horror. It is suggestive of
an idea dreadful enough to make him tremble over his bit of fish, and
shudder in the enjoyment of his mutton-chop&#8212;the idea of being pounded
and crushed into a pulp, and ground by Popish organ-grinders to the
consistence of tomartyr sauce.</p>

<hr />

<h2>THEOCRACY OF RUSSIA.</h2>

<p>The Russians have been hitherto supposed to belong to the Greek
Church;
but there now appears to be some doubt of this. It was lately stated, in
the foreign correspondence of some of our contemporaries, that after a
recent review of his troops by Prince Gortschakoff, the General issued
an order of the day, in which he told the army of occupation that they
were called upon to annihilate Paganism, concluding his address with
"Long live the <span class="smcap">Czar</span>! Long live the God of the
 <span class="smcap">Russians</span>!" If <span class="smcap">Prince
Gortschakoff</span> is to be taken as a correct exponent of Muscovite
divinity,
the religion of the Russians must be identical with that of the <span
class="smcap">Yezidi</span>,
inasmuch as the latter, also, are worshippers of the old gentleman
denominated <span class="smcap">Nicholas</span>.</p>

<h4>"Fast" Literature.</h4>

<p>A sporting "gent," who has courageously entered the "lists" at
several
betting-houses, has lately purchased an elaborate work on "Ethnology,"
in consequence of his having heard that it will give him much
information on the subject of "races."</p>

<h2>OUR BEAUTIFUL FASHIONS OF THE PRESENT DAY.</h2>

<p>Our beautiful fashions go on improving! Like Buckingham Palace, they
are
constantly being altered, and never altered for the better. What the
human <i>façade</i> will be ultimately, there's no knowing. Everything
has
been tried in the shape of flowers, feathers, ornaments on the top, and,
in some instances, paint, that could possibly disfigure it. Let these
disfigurements only continue, and they may have the effect of converting
the human head into a kind of <span class="smcap">Medusa's</span>, that
will turn into stone all
who look at it. One of the latest absurdities is the way in which ladies
wear their bonnets&#8212;if it can be called wearing at all, when it is
falling, like a Capuchin's hood, right down their backs. It thus forms a
capital receptacle for collecting any refuse or rubbish that may be
dropt, or thrown, into it. We know one lady who found her bonnet, when
she got home, perfectly filled with dust. It was quite a dust-bin in a
small way&#8212;and the luncheon, which was on the table at the time, had to
be sent away, as everything was spoilt by the dusty shower that the lady
had unconsciously shaken down upon it.</p>

<p>There was another lady&#8212;whose husband is not so rich as he should be,
and who grumbles fearfully, poor fellow, at every new bonnet he has to
pay for&#8212;who discovered her <i>chapeau</i> to be as full as it could hold
 of
orange-peel. Some malicious little boys must have amused themselves in
walking behind her and pitching into it every piece of orange-peel they
found lying about. It was an amusing game of pitch-in-the-hole to them.
The consequence has been that the lady, who is extremely particular,
especially when she takes a new fancy like a new bonnet into her head,
has been compelled to throw away her old bonnet, and to have a new one.
The poor husband, who is really to be pitied (husbands generally are),
has been obliged, in order to pay for the additional expense, to walk
instead of riding, to give up smoking, and to cut off his luncheons&#8212;all
of which expenses came out of his own pocket and not out of the
housekeeping. The last time he was seen he was so thin that it was
almost a microscopical effort to see him. But this absurd fashion,
coupled with the other absurdity of long dresses, has the one good
effect in keeping our streets clean, for the low bonnets carry off all
the superfluous dust, and the long dresses carry away all the
superfluous mud.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 50%;">
<a href="images/135a.png">
<img src="images/135a.png" alt="Lady in long dress" width="100%" /></a>
</div>

<p>It would be difficult to say which fashion, in point of cleanliness,
ranks the lowest. A classical friend of ours humorously declares that he
thinks the bonnets will soon be the lower of the two, and that the
ladies, for convenience' sake, will shortly be wearing them, tied on to
the end of their dresses. It will be relieving them, he funnily says, of
a great <i>draw-back</i>, and will have the further advantage of keeping
their dear heads cool. This classical friend also says that the ladies,
as viewed at present with their bonnets hanging behind them, look like
female anthropophagi, or "monsters whose heads do grow beneath their
shoulders." However, we have only one hope that the fashion, which seems
to be dropping lower and lower every day, will gradually drop off
altogether, and then the marital cry will be "<i>Il n'y a plus de</i>
Bonnets!" and Cranbourne Street will be ruined. But after all, the
eccentricities in the way of dress do not lie exclusively on the side of
the ladies.</p>

<p>We must not throw every absurdity on their backs. The gentlemen come
in,
also, for a large share of the ridiculous. Look at an elegant young gent
of the present day! His hat you must confess is faultless. It combines
every quality within its lovely chimney-pot form. It has not only beauty
of shape, but utility of purpose. The brim is admirable. A lady-bird can
about settle on it, and that is all. There is just sufficient width to
enable you to lift the hat with, and what more do you want? As for
keeping the sun off, it is not needed for that purpose, for when is the
sun ever seen in England? and as for keeping the rain off, as it is a
well-known fact that no Englishman ever ventures out of doors without
his umbrella, it cannot be needed for that purpose any more than for the
sun. Then look at the shirt-collar! It is a high linen wall, behind
which the face is securely protected from the sharp, cutting winds that
are continually flying about our climate, like so many aërial
guillotines. One's head would infallibly be chopped off, cleaner than
any head of asparagus, if it were not for some such protection; and
besides, we should not find fault with our young men if they do try to
hide as much as they can of their beautiful features. You may be sure
they only do it out of charity to the ladies! The small ribbon that
fences in this high wall of collar is, likewise, most beautiful. It is
almost an invisible fence that is planted evidently more for ornament
than use. The wall would look cold and naked&#8212;a kind of workhouse
wall&#8212;without it. We may say that every part of the dress bespeaks a
degree of taste that would win the admiration even of a savage. In fact,
get a savage&#8212;a greater savage, if you can, than one who beats his wife;
then select a Young Lady and a Young Gent in the present year's
costumes; let the former be as fashionable as you like&#8212;let the latter
be as green as you can find him: then put them before your savage&#8212;turn
them gently round for five minutes, and then ask him his candid opinion.
We will wager our next week's receipts&#8212;no small wager, by the way&#8212;that
he will be puzzled to say&#8212;</p>

<h2>"ENOUGH'S AS GOOD AS A FEAST."</h2>

<p>At the <i>déjeûner</i> given the other day to <span class="smcap">Mr.
 G. V. Brooke</span>, it was stated
by the manager of Drury Lane that after the morning performance, which
took place last week, the public-houses in the neighbourhood of the
theatre were crowded with people, who, after seeing <i>Othello</i>, were
refreshing themselves for the purpose of seeing <i>The Stranger</i> in
the
evening. We admit that two tragedies in one day must be rather warm work
for the audience, as well as for the actors, and we do not wonder at
"refreshment" being found necessary to enable the public to go through
with the day's labours. Some plays are drier than others, and it would
be a curious fact to ascertain how much more washing down <i>The
Stranger</i>
would require than <i>Othello</i>. If we were to attempt a calculation,
we
should say, that if <span class="smcap">Shakspeare</span> took a bottle
of sparkling Moselle,
nothing short of a hogshead of heavy would be needed to make <span
class="smcap">Kotzebue</span> go
down at all glibly.</p>

<hr />

<h4>Another Ghost!</h4>

<p>Of course we continue to receive reports of the appearance of other
ghosts. In the playhouse world, last week, it was reported that the
night watchman on duty at the Princess's was startled by the ghost of
<i>Macbeth</i>. Now, as the theatre does not open until the 10th the
news must be premature.</p>

nominated to be searchers must be fully acquainted with vulgar

their qualifications, but we hope no necessity exists that they should
be guilty of any other, and continue to be rude and insolent. Another
rule provides that no person will be admitted to the service who shall
have committed an offence against the revenue laws. What then has become

<h2>OUR TOURIST IN PARIS.&#8212;No. 6.</h2>

<p>No Englishman can visit the Picture Galleries at the Louvre without
thinking of a building in London devoted to the same purpose, which is
neither very beautiful nor very convenient; and it is rather tempting to
enlarge on the despicable show the Trafalgar Square collection makes
beside the principal Continental ones. The equitable temper, however, of
your Correspondent leads him to suggest some reflections which will
mitigate that censure. The National Gallery was not built by the
luxurious sovereign of an impoverished people, or it might have been
larger and more splendid. No curse cleaves to its stones. The pictures
are not the fruit of rapine and confiscation, or the collection might
have been more extensive and valuable. As it is, it contains less
rubbish and more priceless gems than any gallery of its size in the
world; and no pillaged aristocracy, no humbled province, claims a canvas
there. Such considerations consoled him as he paced up the gilded saloon
of <span class="smcap">Apollo</span> to the square chamber which holds
the masterpieces of the
collection. <span class="smcap">Raphael</span>, <span class="smcap">Paul
 Veronese</span>, <span class="smcap">Leonardo</span>, and <span
class="smcap">Titian</span> appear in all
their glory; but the star of the room and cynosure of neighbouring eyes,
is <span class="smcap">Madame Soult's Murillo</span>&#8212;the <i>Assumption
of Mary</i>. A crowd of devout
admirers cluster always round this great work and the artist who is
employed in copying it. It has the effect of a tender strain from one of
Mozart's masses, sweet and sensous, yet not low. Ladies cannot but be
charmed to see that a saint can be so pretty, and turn with a shudder
from dirty anchorites and unshaven martyrs to gaze again and again at
those lovely eyes, and silky hair, and those elegant hands crossed so
gracefully on her bosom.</p>

<p>Certainly nothing can be more delightful than to sit on the central
ottoman (which by the way is a great deal more comfortable than those
backless rout seats that we wot of), and, shifting one's position from
time to time, study the various marvels of art that clothe the walls of
this saloon. Your Correspondent, like every English gentleman, knows (or
wishes to be thought to know) something about pictures, but he is not
minded to gratify you with the slang that is usually thought necessary
for the proper treatment of this subject. Wherefore he will make no
allusions to breadth, or chiaro-scuro, or texture, or bits of colour.
<span class="smcap">Paul Veronese's</span> <i>Marriage at Cana</i> is
before him, fresh and varied as a
bouquet of flowers, and he wishes to enjoy it as he would digest his
dinner, without giving technical reasons for the process. He turns to a
group of <span class="smcap">Raphael's</span> (I beg pardon, <span
class="smcap">Rafaelle's</span>), and would not for the
world spoil the pleasure they give him by speculating on the Roman
School and the artist's three manners, and the influence of <span
class="smcap">Pietro
Perugino</span> or <span class="smcap">Michael Angelo</span> on his
style, and so forth. These fine art
critics are a cold-blooded set of fellows, and look at a picture as an
attorney does at a lease, to see if they cannot pick a hole in it.</p>

<p>All this time the eyes of the enthusiast have been wandering to a
corner
of the chamber where an artist is copying a small <i>Rembrandt</i>. It
is not
the <i>Rembrandt</i> he is regarding, but the artist. How excessively
nice!
The most charming young lady perched on a pair of steps, like a dear
little bird in a tree. She bends over her work and draws her head back,
and scans the effect on one side and the other with, really, the most
irritating picturesqueness. She wears a blue robe just the colour of her
eyes, with a little ermine tippet, and when an ancient dragon, who is
reading a novel at the foot of the steps, in a cloak and ugly bonnet,
speaks to her, she laughs and shakes her blond <i>chevelure</i>, and is
so
delightful altogether, that it is quite impossible to attend to the
pictures. Let us go into the long gallery where the students are not so
fascinating. Dirty, long-haired, and bearded men in blouses, and females
in seedy crumpled black, look up as we pass by from their easels.</p>

<p>An English family runs past with the blue catalogues in their hands. A
precious bore the whole affair is to them. They must be quick, there is
no time to lose. "What a lot of pictures! Isn't that a funny man with a
beard? How slippery the floor is! <span class="smcap">Rubens</span>, ah,
 really. Come, girls, we
must get back to <span class="smcap">Mewreise's</span> to lunch. There's
 the Bose Arts, and the
Museum of Artillery, and the Bois de Bullown"&#8212;"You should say Bulloyne,
Pa"&#8212;"to be done before dinner."</p>

<p>A long vista of pictures ordered, as all galleries should be,
chronologically. As you enter, mystical compositions, or rather
apparitions of draped angels and saints gaze at you with sleepy eyes
from firmaments of gold. Their limbs are long and gaunt; their looks
grimly devout, and their heads are set awry on their shoulders. Is it
credible that there should be educated men in the present day who yearn
after these barbarisms, and have no sympathy with the struggles made by
subsequent artists to get free from their influence? And that clergymen
should put up copies of the same in our churches, and almost
anathematise as heathens those who prefer better drawing? This period is
the very winter of art, and the next is the spring, all life and
freshness and beauty. We cannot but here remember the young painters in
England who have borrowed a name, if not a principle, from the times
before <span class="smcap">Raphael</span>. Already their works have
become the great point of
attraction in the Royal Academy; already they have reaped the<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
success
of enthusiastic praise, and the still rarer and more precious success of
rancorous abuse. What does our friend <span class="smcap">Ortolan</span>
 say on this subject?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ortolan</span> has a lively sense of every sort
of pleasure. He orders a dinner
better than another man, and enjoys it more; he is a good sportsman, and
well known as a first-rate wicket-keeper at <span class="smcap">Lord's</span>.
 But only his
intimate friends are aware how he appreciates literature and art, and
how solid his acquirements are in both. He is now quietly analysing the
method employed by <span class="smcap">Titian</span> in painting flesh
when he is accosted by your
Correspondent. "What do I think of Pre-Raphaelitism? I don't know what
it means. Where are you to find out? There was a pamphlet certainly with
that title which strongly recommended painting from Nature, but there is
nothing very new in that. All artists paint from Nature, and very sick
it makes one of the wonderful wigs, and satin, and armour, and
plate-glass and china, and fruit and flowers and shiny dogs and deer. I
don't speak of landscape painters, because the writer of that pamphlet
has already proved that the moderns in this line are very superior,
because better imitators than the old. One notion of his may perhaps
pretend to novelty, that a painter should 'select nothing and reject
nothing' in Nature. But I don't understand what he means by this. How
can you avoid selecting and rejecting? I suppose some things are
prettier than others, just as some women are prettier than others. He
can hardly want a man to shut his eyes to what gives him pleasure. If he
does he is wrong, and must know that he's wrong. If not, he must mean
that when you are set down to paint the subject you have selected, you
ought to paint it as it is. If that is all his discovery, what is the
use of making such a fuss about it? Of course you ought, and so every
industrious student does, to the best of his ability. But you must
distinguish between studies and pictures. The first are merely
exercises; the second are, or should be, poems. No one was more aware of
this than the landscape painter whom he worships so devoutly, and who is
generally thought to have pushed poetical treatment of landscapes to an
extreme.</p>

<p>"But, perhaps, this writer does not tell us what we want to know, and
 we
must look for Pre-Raphaelitism in the pictures themselves. Most of them
are clever, and some of them show the very highest ability; but this, of
course, is not the Pre-Raphaelite part of the work, and must be put out
of sight. No new principle can produce <i>genius</i>, though genius may
find
out the new principles. What then remains? Is there a quaintness of form
and manner which reminds one of the early Italian painters? I think
there was a good deal, and still is some, but they happily seem to be
working themselves free from a peculiarity which, to my mind, is neither
more nor less than affectation. Is it an extraordinary fancy for ugly
people that seems occasionally to possess them like an evil spirit? If
this is the new principle, the sooner it is put down the better. There
are quite enough frights in the world without stereotyping them for the
delectation of all time. Or is it a toilsome elaboration of detail,
which not one man out of a thousand could ever see without a glass? I
confess, that even where the minute objects themselves form the subject
of the picture, this painful execution is quite oppressive to me. I seem
to be looking through an inverted telescope, which gives everything a
hard outline that I never see in Nature myself, and never want to see;
and further, while there is an atmosphere, I don't believe anybody else
can see. But where this minute detail is merely accessory to the subject
of the picture, there I hold the system to be wrong and false in the
strongest sense. It is, of course, very catching to talk about imitating
Nature exactly, but one simple test will show that for dramatic or
poetical subjects it won't do. Dress up two models as carefully as you
like, put them into appropriate attitudes, take a calotype of the group,
copy it exactly on the canvas, call it <i>Hamlet and the Ghost</i>, and
then
ask yourself what notion it gives you of <span class="smcap">Shakspere</span>.
 Imitation of Nature
is only an expedient. The end of Art is to please."</p>

<h2>THE CROWN OF ST. STEPHEN.</h2>

<p>The new-found crown of Hungary has been brought in great state to
Vienna, and with like state returned again to Hungary. The reason for
this (we impart the news to the reader as private and confidential)
was&#8212;<span class="smcap">Baron Lionel Rothschild</span>, having examined
the diadem, refused to
lend a single penny upon it. The real, original stones have been taken
out, but we understand the Pope has, in the handsomest manner, proposed
to supply other gems of far surpassing value&#8212;namely, no other than
half-a-dozen of the pebbles that stoned <span class="smcap">St. Stephen</span>

<p>The arms of Austria are the eagle; the double-headed eagle. When,

Austria are surely not eagles, but&#8212;as <span class="smcap">Nokes</span>,

<h2>HOW TO PAY YOUR TAXES.</h2>

<p class="salute">"<span class="smcap">Mr. Punch,</span></p>

<p>"Direct Taxation may be compensated for by cheapness; but it is very
painful. When we are compelled to pay a lot of money at once, we feel a
pang which the disbursement of twice as much distributed over a longer
period, in small additions to our expenditure, does not occasion. The
latter case resembles the gradual extraction of a single hair: the
former is equivalent to having a whole handful torn right out. You know
that you may lose a quantity of blood by frequent leeching, which, if
abstracted at once from your system, would make you faint. I am still
suffering from the recent payment of my assessed taxes; and shall not
lose the horrible sensation for a week. As to the Income-Tax&#8212;it has the
effect of a fine: a regular punishment. Couldn't these dreadful
penalties be paid by instalments? I declare I am almost determined the
next time I am forced to undergo one of them, to have myself put under
the influence of chloroform. I have sometimes thought of brandy instead;
but I have a generous weakness, which spirituous liquors are apt to
stimulate, and I am afraid that if I were to pay my Income-Tax in the
state I allude to, I should fling down a few guineas over the amount as
a voluntary contribution, overcome with enthusiastic devotion to my
<span class="smcap">Queen</span> and Country.</p>

<a href="images/137.png">
<img src="images/137.png" alt="cartoon" width="100%" /></a>
</div>

<p>We have a bone to pick with our contemporaries. In reporting the
speech
of <span class="smcap">Lord Palmerston</span>, at Perth, they recorded a
 passage in which the noble
Lord suggested that those who saw and heard things that were going
wrong, should communicate them to the public officer whose duty it is to
put them right, which would be conferring a great favour on the man in
office, as well as doing a benefit of magnitude to the country at large.
They represent his Lordship as saying, in continuation:&#8212;</p>

<blockquote><p>"There may be a great deal of chaff in that which is
received&#8212;but
if in a bushel of chaff he shall find a pint of good corn, that
bushel of chaff would be worth winnowing, and he can turn that pint
of corn to good purposes."</p></blockquote>

<p>But why has that been omitted which followed of course, and by the
omission of which the above extract is made to conclude with
abruptness&#8212;to read, as it were, broken off, stumpy? What motive, but a
mean one, was there for suppressing what <span class="smcap">Lord
Palmerston</span> must have gone
on to say?&#8212;namely, that in communicating to Government information
respecting things that go wrong, mixed up with chaff, the most essential
services had been rendered to an applauding nation by a popular
periodical&#8212;which modesty prevents <i>Punch</i> from more distinctly
alluding
to.</p>

<h2>CIVIC SIMPLICITY.</h2>

<p>The next Lord Mayor's Day is, we are told, to be celebrated with
touching simplicity. Gilt gingerbread has had its day; and Bartholomew
Fair being abolished, the Lord Mayor's coach will follow the gilt
chanticleers-in-trowsers and other gorgeous gingerbread. <span
class="smcap">Mr. Alderman
Wire's</span> liveries are very simple, but very significant. Being a
lawyer,
he has put characteristic facings on his profession, clothing his
coachman and footmen in suits of parchment with shoulder-knots of red
tape. The effect is very handsome. The worthy Sheriff's motto, <i>Vincit
qui patitur</i>, is very happy, and is beautifully engrossed upon the
cuffs
and collars. <i>Vincit qui patitur.</i> He conquers who suffers! How
often is
it illustrated in law. He who wins, <i>pays</i>!</p>

<h2>MILITARY REWARDS IN CHINA.</h2>

<p>The Chinese heroes who are now cutting off each other's tails and
mutilating each other's limbs, appear to realise a far larger quantity
of kicks than halfpence by their warlike achievements. Even a successful
general seems to make but a sorry business of it, for the renowned
<span class="smcap">Hiang-Yung</span>, after taking a bridge and a few
other important positions,
was rewarded for his heroic exploits by "permission to wear a yellow
riding jacket." The poor fellow seems to have been regularly jockied by
his Imperial master. Military rewards are evidently cheap in China, for
"peacock's-feathers," "strike-lights," and "pen-knives," are enumerated
as the articles of which the <span class="smcap">Emperor</span> is most
lavish to his successful
soldiers.</p>

<p>We wonder what our <span class="smcap">Wellington</span> would have
said to a bunch of cock's tails
after Torres Vedras, by way of having so many feathers in his cap; or a
box of lucifers as a light recognition of his services at Waterloo.
There must be a true relish for military glory among the Chinese
generals, if they are sufficiently "pleased by a feather" to risk their
lives in the hope of obtaining a bit of a peacock's tail on which to
plume themselves, and are prepared to carry on "war to the knife" with a
pen-knife in prospect by way of acknowledgment. If a more civilised
commander were, after a brilliant achievement, to be offered a
pen-knife, he would probably use it to "cut his stick," and leave the
service for ever.</p>

<h4>"Another and Another still Succeeds."</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Byron</span> has informed us that "Mont Blanc is

how are we to describe <span class="smcap">Albert Smith</span>, who
seems determined to make
himself the "Monarch of Mont Blanc?" It is true that he could scarcely
fix upon a higher point for the summit of his ambition. If he has chosen
that particular walk in life, though it is laborious and slippery, we
see no reason why he should not repeat his "terrific ascent" as often as
he feels disposed. If he should continue to go "up, up, up" for another
year, we shall begin to look upon the ascent of Mont Blanc as <span
class="smcap">Albert
"Smith's</span> work in general."</p>

</div>

<p>Reform of the extortionate system of British Hotels might be
commenced
with an alteration of their nomenclature, consisting in a judicious
allotment of nicknames. The good old English signs of the Dragon, the
Lion, Red or Black, and such like, should be taken as examples of the
principle on which all those places of plunder should be designated.
Those time-honoured appellations are recommended not only by their
antiquity but by their candour, and we would have every extravagant Inn,
that is, almost every Inn in the kingdom, that does not rejoice in one
of them, denoted and commonly called and known by a similar kind of
title; as, The Crocodile, The Boa Constrictor, The Hyena, The Condor,
The Wolf, The Ogre, in order to signify that it is the den of a ravenous
monster that subsists by devouring travellers.</p><br />

<span class="smcap">Shadrack and Co.</span>&#8212;from fifty-five to sixty per

spoiled by some very bad names on the back of it.</p>

<h2>THE EMPEROR AT BOULOGNE</h2>

<center>(<i>By our own Eye-Witness.</i>)</center>

<p><span class="smcap">Boulogne</span> has for some weeks presented the
miserable aspect of a sort of
daylight Vauxhall, or the "behind the scenes" portion of a theatre at
rehearsal time. The "<span class="smcap">Emperor</span>" having been
expected nearly a month ago,
the "authorities" who had made him captive in 1840 determined to
captivate him in 1853 by turning the town into a series of "bowers of
bliss" by the aid of at least 1000 scaffolding poles and some millions
of yards of evergreens. The "authorities," having formed themselves into
a sort of committee of stage management, proceeded to get up the scenery
and properties a month ago; and during that month, the equinoctial gales
have been shifting the scenery and distributing the properties in a most
vague and impartial manner. Several "triumphal arches" have been for the
last three weeks staggering in a sort of drunken state in the middle of
the principal thoroughfares. The festoons of "evergreens" have been
helplessly hanging about in a condition which shows that the immortality
of their greenness is a mere myth, for we never saw a collection of
used-up tea-leaves looking so thoroughly "done brown" as the long lines
of deceased box, dangling about in the blustering breath of <span
class="smcap">Boreas</span>. The
rain, as if mistaking them for real "tea-leaves," and hoping to get
still some good out of them, has kept them in almost a perpetual soak,
and the pavements have been strewed with the dying or dead asparagus in
that feathery state it assumes when the asparagus has all gone, and the
plants have taken it into their heads to put forth a rather graceful but
unprofitable luxuriance of green-stuff.</p>

<p>We must give every credit to the "getting up" of the "<span
class="smcap">Emperor's</span>"
reception, for we certainly never saw so many "set scenes" employed in a
single act, and when we remember that the act was a mere farce, the
expense incurred seems still more remarkable.</p>

<p>The "properties" were also on the most elaborate scale, and the
pasteboard eagles were equal to any owl we ever saw in the palmiest days
of <i>Der Freischülz</i>. Immense "troops of auxiliaries" and
"supernumeraries" in military uniforms were engaged expressly for the
occasion, and as these had to be billeted on the inhabitants, there were
instances of a quiet English family or two having to entertain a
dragoon, while in one case the choice between a colonel, or two
lieutenants, or four privates was offered to a quaker, who was residing
at Boulogne for retirement.</p>

<p>There could be no objection to any amount of obsequiousness in which
the
Boulonnais themselves might indulge, but surely a "loyal address" from
the English to any sovereign but their own was somewhat superfluous.
Nevertheless such a document was got up and was actually signed by
<span class="smcap">Doctor Somebody</span>, <span class="smcap">Mrs.
Somebody</span>, <span class="smcap">Miss Somebody</span>, <span
class="smcap">Miss Anna Maria Somebody</span>,
<span class="smcap">Master J. Somebody</span>, and a lot of little <span
 class="smcap">Somebodies</span> or <span class="smcap">Nobodies</span>,
 who we
suppose had a family meeting with Papa or Mamma in the chair, to appoint
a deputation to "go up" with the piece of flatulent flattery to the
"<span class="smcap">Emperor</span>." We can excuse the address of the <i>matelottes</i>,
 presented by a
very venerable <i>matelotte</i>, who read to the sham <span
class="smcap">Napoleon</span> the very same
address that she had read to the real <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>
 "forty years ago, in the
maturity of her beauty" (what a beauty she must be in 1853 if she was
full-blown in 1804); but we cannot understand what pretext there could
be for a few English old women and children expressing their "loyalty"
to the present "<span class="smcap">Emperor</span>."</p>

<p>Their "Majesties" entered the lower town, having been "washed, just
washed in a shower," which came on as they approached the
Sous-Préfecture, and a vast crowd of umbrellas was all that could be
seen by the assembled multitude. There was all the usual humbug of
receiving the keys, which are never used, and would of course refuse to
fit the lock, which in its turn would inevitably decline to act, and the
Imperial couple were then dragged about in the rain, under the drippings
from the festoons and through the theatrical arches, one of which was
designed after the <i>Arc d'étoile</i>, being itself in reality an <i>arc
 de
toile</i>&#8212;or arch of canvas. No sooner had their "Majesties" left the
town
than our old friend <span class="smcap">Boreas</span> began to puff and
blow through all the
streets, which he very rapidly cleared of all their "thousand additional
lights," sending the paper lanterns through the air on all sides, and
whisking away the evergreen festoons, which were instantly turned into
skipping ropes by the delighted <i>gamins</i>. Thus, like everything
else,
the whole affair of the "<span class="smcap">Emperor's</span>" visit to
Boulogne was speedily blown
over.</p>

<h2>ANOTHER INSULT TO IRELAND!</h2>

<center>(<i>From the Nation.</i>)</center>

<p>"It is reported that the ever glorious <span class="smcap">John
Mitchell</span> has escaped from
the blood-red hands of the sanguinary Saxon. And what has been the
reward offered for his apprehension? Why '£2 or such <i>lesser sum</i>
as may
be determined upon by the convicting magistrate!' Forty shillings for
that heroic martyr! Oh, my countrymen, does not the brutal <i>Times</i>,
every day of its atrocious existence, offer more for a strayed cur&#8212;a
wandering puppy-dog? And forty shillings (or less) for the hope of
Erin!"</p>

<p>It would seem that the Colonial Government has orders to treat Irish
patriots, as at rural fairs and merry-makings the master of ceremonies
treats pigs; namely&#8212;to grease well their tails, that they may the more
easily slip out of hand.</p>

<h4>Theatrical Act of Grace.</h4>

<p>Our theatrical readers will rejoice to know that <span class="smcap">Mr.
 Charles Kean</span> will
re-open the Princess's with an act of clemency. The play-going world
lamented to learn that, <span class="smcap">Mr. Kean</span>&#8212;in pursuance
 of a high, unflinching
principle&#8212;had erased the <span class="smcap">Queen's</span> name from
the List, for having
incautiously laughed at Free <span class="smcap">Mr. Braid's</span>
imitation of <span class="smcap">Mr. Kean</span>. We are
happy to learn, however, that <span class="smcap">Her Majesty's</span>
name has been restored,
intelligence to that effect having, last week, been sent from the
Box-office to Balmoral.</p>

<hr />

<h2>MAHOGANY POSSESSED.</h2>

<p>There is something in Table-moving&#8212;and we imagined that <span
class="smcap">Faraday</span> had
discovered what that was. At least we thought that if he had not, the
Deuce was in it; and we were right&#8212;but right in the alternative. The
phenomenon, according to the demonstration of two Anglican divines, is
produced by "Satanic Agency." The old broker of souls is the man in
possession of mahogany. The <span class="smcap">Rev. N. S. Godfrey</span>,
 Incumbent of Wortley,
Leeds, and the <span class="smcap">Rev. E. Gillson</span>, Curate of
Lyncombe and Widcombe, Bath,
have respectively printed and published evidence of this fact. They have
witnessed the change of mahogany into Satan-wood. They have seen the
tables talk with their legs by knocking on the floor, and they give us
dialogues which they have held, personally, with these articles of
furniture; questions put and genuine answers returned, with the
stamp&#8212;without which none are genuine. From these answers they conclude
that the leg of the table is connected with a cloven foot.</p>

<p>The tables, indeed, candidly confessed to both of these clergymen
that
they were actuated by evil spirits, one of which described itself as a
lost soul, by the name of <span class="smcap">Alfred Brown</span>, but
appeared, by the testimony
of another, to have an <i>alias</i>. This rogue of a spirit asserted
that he
could move the table without the hands of the experimenters; which, when
tested, however, he could not do; and it certainly seems that
table-moving cannot be accomplished unless somebody else, besides the
devil, has a hand in it.</p>

<p>That personage is familiarly denominated the Old Gentleman. His table
talk justifies his title to that appellation, by showing that he is in
his dotage. The demons that possess the tables contradict themselves on
cross examination in a way unparalleled by the stupidest liar that ever
stood in a witness box. The Baronet whose case broke down the other day
was a very adept in fiction, compared to the Father of it&#8212;speaking by
tables. Besides it is very silly of him&#8212;not the Baronet but the
other&#8212;to disclose himself at all. If his great object is to get people
to come to him, he could do nothing more likely to defeat it than to go
to them, and thus convince the British Public of his existence. "The
Devil is an Ass" is now something more than the title of a comedy.</p>

<p>The tables refused to move when the Bible was placed upon them&#8212;though
one did lift its leg by trying very hard "slowly and heavily," under the
burden of a New Testament. But another was equally restive beneath a
slip of paper whereon was written the name of "<span class="smcap">Satan</span>."
 So it was under
other names, not to be repeated here. Now, all this is grossly
inconsistent on the part of one who has always been considered the very
Prince of Plausibility.</p>

<p>However, both of the reverend gentlemen denounce all doubt touching
the
correctness of their reference of these things to diabolical agency, as
profane scepticism; and under these circumstances we have besought the
advice of our venerated Rector, the <span class="smcap">Rev. Dr. Dryport</span>;
 who told us that
he believed in no supernatural events whatever, the acknowledgment of
which was not required by the Thirty-Nine Articles. He added that if he
saw a table, moving without physical agency, stopped, independently of
simple weight, by the superposition of a Bible, he should be disposed to
let the volume remain where it was, and apply himself to the study of
its contents. If he had reason to suppose that the devil was in the
table, he should let him alone, and have nothing to say to him unless he
were sure he had the power to cast him out of it.</p>

<p>We asked the Reverend Doctor what he thought of the following extract
from the pamphlet of <span class="smcap">Mr. Gillson</span>.</p>

<blockquote><p>"I then asked, 'Where are <span class="smcap">Satan's</span>
 head-quarters? Are they in
England?' There was a slight movement. 'Are they in France?' A
violent movement. 'Are they in Spain?' Similar agitation. 'Are they
at Rome?' The table literally seemed frantic.... 'Do you know the
Pope?' The table was violently agitated."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Dryport</span> answered that he supposed the
table must have been one that
had been used at Exeter Hall, and probably acted under influence from
that quarter&#8212;of a mechanical nature. He should think that one of the
parties touching the table was a very zealous Protestant.</p>

<p>We inquired if there would be any harm in our trying if tables would
move by the imposition of our hands? He replied that there could be no
doubt that they were moved by an imposition practised by hand, but if we
had any, there was no objection to our making the experiment. We,
therefore, chose twelve honest men, constituting, in fact, a British
jury, and got them to lay their hands on a substantial dinner-table,
which presently began to move. The following dialogue ensued:</p>

<p>"Where are the head-quarters of despotism? Are they in England?"
There
was no movement. "Are they in France?" A violent movement. "Are they in
Austria?" A tremendous movement. "Are they in Russia?" The table jumped
and bounced, and tumbled from side to side in such a manner that one
might have imagined that a quantity of brandy and water had been spilt
upon it and made it furiously drunk.</p>

<p>"Do you know <span class="smcap">Old Nicholas</span>?" The table
capsized, went right over;
completely upset.</p>

<p>After that, what question can there be about the "agency" concerned
in
Table-moving? <span class="smcap">Dr. Dryport</span>, however, will have
 it that <span class="smcap">Mr. Godfrey</span> and
<span class="smcap">Mr. Gillson</span> have not been having
communication with evil spirits, and
that whatever those gentlemen may say for themselves, they are no
conjurors.</p>

<p>Last night, an alarming riot took place in Printing-house Square.
About
five hundred hotel-keepers&#8212;represented by their signs&#8212;attacked the
<i>Times'</i> office.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Red Bull</span> swore "he'd toss the whole
bilin of 'em for a pint. He
ought to know something of rumpsteaks; and 5<i>s.</i> a head warn't too
much
for 'em."</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Angel</span> wondered that any gentlemen who <i>was</i>
 a gent <i>could</i> object to
wax-candles to go to bed with. The <span class="smcap">Angel</span>
abominated compo; hoping she
knew what real light was.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Goat-in-Boots</span> said kids, other ways
children, over nine, ought to be
charged for as full-growd. Some little gals was women at eight.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Cock-and-Bottle</span> was above trumpeting
anything. But how could any
gent expect a pint of port under three-and-six?</p>

<p>At least a dozen <span class="smcap">Bears</span>&#8212;growling their
loudest&#8212;said, seeing the expense
at which they sat, swore they couldn't afford a sandwich under a
shilling.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Adam-and-Eve</span> never heard of such a
thing as "a dressing-room."
Wondered what next?</p>

<p>At this time the increased crowd of <span class="smcap">Red Lions</span>,
 <span class="smcap">White Bulls</span>, <span class="smcap">Black
Horses</span>, began to roar and bellow, and snort and neigh and kick in
 the
most appalling style. The hubbub becoming unendurable, the Editor&#8212;after
due warning given by the publisher&#8212;threw up the window in the face of
the mob, and fired a leading article over their heads. Upon this, the
crowd quietly separated.</p>

<h2>ANOTHER MONEY QUESTION.</h2>

<p class="salute">"<span class="smcap">Dearest Punchy</span>,</p>

<p>"I don't feel quite safe&#8212;as I have a large money-bag, full of 'lucky
pieces', <i>every one of which is more or less disfigured, or defaced</i>.
Some are bent, some are chipped or cut, some have holes bored through
them to enable any one to wear them round his neck, and every one has
something the matter with it. Now I have been all my life collecting
these lucky coins&#8212;and I am sure there must be five or six pound's worth
of them altogether&#8212;at all events a great deal more than I should like
to have taken from me. Besides they all represent a 'charm' against
fits, against the small-pox, or some calamity or other; and it would be
very hard if my 'lucky pieces,' instead of bringing me good-luck, were
the cause of my lasting sorrow and ruin. Do you think they could carry
me to the Tower for having them in my possession, or would they send me
to New South Wales? My aunt tells me they are of no kind of value; but
that I will never believe, for what was once a shilling must be always a
shilling, though I should not like to be dragged off to the
Police-office in the event of my buying a paper of pins in order to test
its value.</p>

<h2>TREMENDOUS EFFECTS OF A KISS.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Nicholas</span> and <span class="smcap">Francis
Joseph</span> have met at Olmütz; met and affectionately
fraternised. For we are told that "loud applause followed from the
spectators as the Emperors publicly <i>kissed</i> each other: and then
the
Court dinner followed, the two Emperors spending the evening together in
undisturbed <i>privacy</i>." But this scene (<i>see last week's Punch</i>)
 our
artist has already immortalised; he having sketched the Imperial
couple&#8212;even as in an old play&#8212;"from behind the arras." The royal
salute has been embalmed in the lines of the Austrian Poet Laureat,
<span class="smcap">Doctor Von Wattz</span>:&#8212;</p>

<div class="poem1"><div class="stanza">

</p><p class="i0">When the Emperors of the like kid-ney,</p>
<p class="i2">Do kiss left cheek and right."</p>
</div></div>

<p>But other, and deeper effects resulted from that Imperial smack! And
such a smack! As though a red-hot poker should have kissed a barrel of
gunpowder. For as cheeks were kissed&#8212;</p>

<p>Poland writhed and groaned afresh!&#8212;</p>

<p>Hungary clenched her red right hand, and renewed her silent vow!&#8212;</p>

<p>Turkey, with a flourish of the sabre, set her teeth, and cried "<i>Allah!

<p>Naples&#8212;through <span class="smcap">King Bomba</span>&#8212;cried "<i>Ancora</i>;

<p>And <span class="smcap">Aberdeen</span>, folding pacific hands,

<h2>AN AFFAIR WITH THE (KNIGHTSBRIDGE) CAFFRES.</h2>

<p>We thought we had heard enough of the rows with the Caffres at the
Cape;
but there have lately been some Caffres cutting the oddest capers at
Hyde Park Corner. It seems that a noble Caffre chieftain has entered
into an agreement for himself and a few of his tribe to howl, leap,
brandish tomahawks, and indulge in other outlandish freaks, coming under
the head of "native customs," for a year and a half, during which period
the howlings, tomahawkings, &amp;c., are to be the exclusive property of
 an
individual who has speculated on the appetite of the British public for
yells and wild antics. Things were going on pretty comfortably, with the
exception of an occasional "outbreak"&#8212;which means the breaking-in by a
Caffre of some other Caffre's, or somebody else's head&#8212;when the chief
was seized with a generous desire to make a gratuitous exhibition of
himself, and accordingly <span class="smcap">Nkuloocoolo</span>&#8212;as the
chief calls himself&#8212;took a
turn in the Park on Thursday last with four of his fellow countrymen.</p>

<p>The proprietor of the yells and native dances, fearful that the gilt
would be taken off the gingerbread complexions of the Caffres if their
faces were made familiar to the public in Hyde Park, sent a policeman to
take the "chief" into custody. <span class="smcap">Nkuloocoolo</span>,
however, who seems to take
the thing coolly as well as cavalierly&#8212;or Caffrely&#8212;refused to walk in,
but stood outside the door, rendering it hopeless that anybody would pay
half-a-crown to "walk up," when the chief was to be seen "alive, alive"
for nothing at the threshold. The proprietor endeavoured to push the
chief inside, but the chief gave a counter-push, and there seemed a
probability of a war-whoop being got up at the expense rather than for
the benefit of the enterprising individual who had engaged the whoopers.
Upon this the chief was taken into custody and charged with an assault,
and with having desired the proprietor (in Caffre) to "look out"&#8212;an
expression which, though not very alarming in English, seems to have had
in Caffre a very frightful effect on the mind of the hearer. Perhaps,
being familiar with the club exercise of the Caffres, he might have
reason to fear that their "native customs" would make them rather
awkward customers.</p>

<p>The complainant was, however, most properly told by the Magistrate
that
the Caffres cannot, by law, be restrained from going wherever they
please, though they may have agreed to whoop and yell, but their
whooping and yelling can only be enforced by civil process. If a Caffre
chooses to take a walk in the Park, or anywhere else, he has a perfect
right to do so, if he does not break the law by tomahawking the public,
or any other "native" eccentricity. The "proprietor" seemed to feel
himself rather aggrieved that he could not dispose of the Caffres in any
way he pleased, but it would be rather too absurd, that the principle of
slavery and absolute control over the person of a human being should be
recognised for the benefit of an individual who has speculated in the
attraction of savage yells and barbarian antics.</p>

<hr />

<h2>THE PARSON'S PARLIAMENT.</h2>

<p>Every now and then we read in the papers an account of the
Convocation
of Prelates and Clergy, at which, by general consent, nothing seems to
be done, and nobody appears to be present. If this assembly, which never
assembles, and a body, which nobody troubles himself to form, is
supposed to represent the Church, we must admit that the representation
is&#8212;as far as sinecurism is concerned&#8212;a very faithful one. The
proceedings at the last meeting consisted of a rather dull duett,
between the Archbishop's commissioner and his Grace's registrar. The
latter in a lengthened solo gave the whole writ of prorogation at full
length, and the former chimed in at the conclusion with an announcement
that the business of the day was ended. The scene of this melancholy
farce is always the Jerusalem Chambers. It would perhaps give life to
the scene if <span class="smcap">Mr. Cook</span> would lend from <span
class="smcap">Astley's</span> a Jerusalem pony or two
by way of affording a little fit companionship to the commissioner and
registrar, who must be rather sick of each other, and might be glad to
welcome a little congenial society. The addition we have suggested might
be sanctioned, under the plea that the Vicar of Bray would then have a
representative.</p>

<h2>OUR CITY ARTICLE.</h2>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/144a.png" alt="T" class="cap" width="30%" />

<p class="cap_2">THE present financial crisis appears to demand from <i>Mr.
 Punch</i> one of
those Money Articles with which he has stepped forward in other times of
difficulty, and which have instantly restored stability and confidence.
Regardless, therefore, of his own personal comfort, he attended the
Stock Market one day during the past week.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Mr. Punch</i> was struck by the exceeding helplessness of the
gentlemen in
whose hands is the political thermometer, better known as the Funds.
They displayed an avidity in grasping at the slightest hint, which was
only equalled by the hurry with which they sprang away to do something,
before they comprehended the real bearing of the information. Indeed, if
these gentlemen of the Stock Exchange waited until they understood the
actual tendency of the events upon which they deal, some of them might
wait long enough. <i>Mr. Punch</i> casually remarked to a friend that
"<span class="smcap">Aberdeen</span> was out this morning," and there
was a rush of fifty men eager
to buy on account of the good news. Had they paused to hear <i>Mr. Punch</i>
add, "walking in Kensington Gardens," they might have spared their
trouble. Subsequently, the same gentleman was heard to say, "Not so
tight as it was." Away hurried the correspondents of the papers, and
told everybody that the tightness of the market was disappearing. <i>Mr.
Punch</i> merely alluded to his hat, which had been a little
uncomfortable
until he had his hair cut. "Will open flatly," an observation <i>Mr.
Punch</i> simply applied to the Princess's Theatre, was construed into a
prophecy of the state of the Market next day, and business was done
accordingly. But the greatest <i>coup</i>, and one for which <span
class="smcap">Mr. Gladstone</span>
owes <i>Mr. Punch</i> a good turn, was the latter gentleman's saying, as
 he
left the Exchange, "Those new Stocks are the best, because they always
keep up so well." The new creations, for whose non-popularity the
<span class="smcap">Chancellor of the Exchequer</span> has been much
twitted by financiers who do
not know discount from premium, immediately sprang into activity, and
yet <i>Mr. Punch's</i> remark was simply <i>apropos</i> of his friend's
wearing a
rather seedy tie round his neck. He hopes that Exchequer Bill, as the
<span class="smcap">Right Hon. William</span> is rather irreverently
called in the City, will
remember this good service next time <i>Mr. Punch</i> hints that it is
time
the duty should come off paper.</p>

<p>While the news was favourable to Russia, the Bears were very elate,
but
as soon as it was known that <i>Punch</i> had declared against <span
class="smcap">Aberdeen</span> and
for an English policy, the Bulls exulted. <span class="smcap">Shakspere</span>
 was quoted at
random, but usually wrongly. The jobbers were scarce, owing to the Irish
Brigade being out of the country. There was a rumour that a large
operator had come, but it turned out to be only a fat surgical
practitioner who had mistaken his way, and was, of course, exposed to
the graceful jocularity of the House. A Bank Director came on and made
some practical jokes, from which it was surmised that the Bank reserve
was very small. Prices jumped about on every side, and so did little
boys, whom the beadle chased, declaring he would have them there at no
price. Some of the speculators appeared very uneasy, especially those
who had a good way to go home, and thought it was going to rain.
Finally, <i>Mr. Punch</i> was informed that things closed with much
firmness
at four, but he believes this must apply to the gates.</p>

<p>Under all circumstances, <i>Mr. Punch</i> strongly advises holders to
 be
neither rash nor fearful, while sellers should abstain alike from
temerity and timidity. All parties had better be guided by
circumstances, and not attempt to lay down Medo-Persian rules for
themselves. Let Prudence be their beacon, and Wisdom their chart. They
will do well to watch the course of events, but not to surmise that they
understand them, while at the same time taking care not to shut their
eyes to contingencies. A thing may happen, or it may not, but the wise
man will discern the signs of the times. By following this advice, which
<i>Mr. Punch</i> has carefully framed upon the model of what is given by
 all
the recognised financial authorities, he has no doubt that through the
shoals of the present crisis the Bark of Public Confidence may be
steered into the haven of prosperity.</p>

<hr />

<h2>THE IMPERTINENCE OF SCIENCE.</h2>

<p>Somebody has invented an instrument which he calls a Lunarium, and
which
is calculated to look so very closely into the Moon's face, that the
Moon's age&#8212;exact to a quarter of an hour&#8212;may be discovered. Really
this seems hardly fair towards the Moon, for it ought to be remembered
that</p>

<center>"Luna, Luna, Luna's a lady."</center>

<p>and no lady&#8212;at least none of our acquaintance&#8212;could stand against the
force of an instrument so powerful as to detect every furrow, wrinkle,
or even crease in her countenance. It is all very well for the sons of
science to be continually staring Luna in the face, through the medium
of powerful telescopes; but having satisfied themselves of the "Moon's
Age," they might surely be satisfied without continually publishing the
fact for the gratification of an impertinent curiosity.</p>

<hr />

<h4>MODERN MYTHOLOGY.</h4>

<p>One of our serious contemporaries, in recording a fashionable
marriage,
describes the bride as "led to the hymenæal altar." The nuptial rites
were celebrated at St. George's, Hanover Square; and we are further
informed that the <span class="smcap">Rev. Berry M. Huntingdon</span>
officiated. We did not know
that the priests of Hymen were styled Reverend, nor were we aware that
the divinity in question had any altar in St. George's church.</p>

<h2>OUR TOURIST IN PARIS.&#8212;No. 7.</h2>

<p>It would be a mistake for a person of taste to leave Paris without
dining at <span class="smcap">Philippe's</span>, the great artist, who
dwells in the Rue
Montorgueil. There is the very highest authority (an Ex-Chancellor, a
Bishop or two, and my friend <span class="smcap">Jollyboy</span>) for
stating that this house is by
far the best in the city; and so, Sir, having the interests of your
paper and my country in view, I accepted the invitation of <span
class="smcap">Harry
Ortolan</span>, himself no bad judge, to meet a small party there. There
 were
old <span class="smcap">Martingale</span> and <span class="smcap">Sheffield
 Higson</span>, and <span class="smcap">De Courcy</span> of the Embassy,
 a
young Frenchman named <span class="smcap">Monsieur Frédéric Hulot</span>,
 protocol, <span class="smcap">De Faulter</span>, and
your Correspondent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hulot</span> (a great ass) who dresses <i>à
l'Anglais</i> in a <i>pantalon à la
gentlemens-ridéres</i>, and rides a grey mare with very long legs in the
Champs Elysées, fastened on to <span class="smcap">Martingale</span>,
and gabbled away about <i>le
Liverpool Stipple Chase</i> and <span class="smcap">Monsieur Mason</span>,
 wanting to know how much an
English horse, pure blood, would cost. He was to be showy and very
quiet. <span class="smcap">Martingale</span> rather bluntly told him, he
 had better learn to ride,
before he thought of buying a horse. <span class="smcap">De Faulter</span>
 invited your
Correspondent to come and play <i>écarté</i> at the Cercle some evening.
 A
very friendly nice fellow. He was in some cavalry regiment, but sold
out. I forget why he left the Rag. Perhaps it was too noisy a club for
him. <span class="smcap">Sheffield Higson</span> was holding forth, to
the great disgust of <span class="smcap">De
Courcy</span>, about the English constitution, maintaining the universal
corruption of the Church and aristocracy, and looking forward to the
time when <span class="smcap">Mr. Cobden</span> should be at the head of
 Foreign Affairs, and <span class="smcap">Mr.
Bright</span> at the War Office; the revenues of the Church of England
being
divided <i>pro ratâ</i> among the schools of various denominations. To
confess the truth, <span class="smcap">Higson</span> spoils the effect
of his excellent political
principles by the grossest toad-eating. He never can speak without
mentioning some lord as his intimate friend. <span class="smcap">De
Courcy</span> listened to his
speculations in horror, and was quite unable to profess his own simple
faith&#8212;that the House of Peers and the country gentlemen had an
exclusive right to the government, and that the devil was the first
Whig. He could only turn away, and mutter something about "an infernal
snob." <span class="smcap">Protocol</span> was boring our host with his
views on the Zollverein.
Altogether we were uncomfortable together, and were all delighted when
dinner was announced.</p>

<p>The <i>huîtres de Marenne</i>, those genuine treasures of the deep,
had
disappeared when <span class="smcap">Ortolan</span>, filling a glass of
old Grave, said, "Do you
know I hate a fellow who says he doesn't like a good dinner. It's
generally humbug, and when it isn't that, it's something worse. It shows
a want of humanity: he might just as well not like virtue, or be
indifferent about cleanliness. A good dinner is better than a bad
dinner, exactly as a good man is better than a bad man; and to be
without a taste, is as much a defect as to be without a heart. An
ancient philosopher" (<span class="smcap">Ortolan</span> is literary,
and has read <span class="smcap">Athenæs</span>) "has
defined man as a cooking animal, with great justice. Advance in cookery
accompanies advance in civilisation, and they doubtless will both reach
perfection at the same time. The culinary art has a direct effect in
refining mankind; in the beautiful words of the <i>Latin Grammar</i>, it
 is
emollient to the manners; nor does it allow them to be rough." (<span
class="smcap">Higson</span>,
who has no Latin, here sneered visibly.) "After this <i>potage bisque
aux
écrévisses</i>, we feel our hearts expand in universal philanthropy. Who
would grovel amid lower dirt when he can nourish his essence with stuff
so ambrosial?"</p>

<p>"Well, for my part," said honest <span class="smcap">Martingale</span>,
 "I don't care about your
French flummery&#8212;it's all to hide the taste of the meat. Give me a steak
of good English beef, you know what you're eating then. Who knows what
this patty has inside it?" "You old heathen," exclaimed the epicure with
pity, "eat therefore without inquiry; you should never work your
intellect at the same time with your digestion, or you will spoil the
operation of both. Eat in silence, for it is good, and thank the happy
age and country which puts such delicate things before its sons."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martingale</span> grumbled about fellows
worshipping a certain portion of their
physical constitution, but devoted himself nevertheless to the
suspicious <i>paté</i> with great success. The enthusiasm of the less
prejudiced part of the guests, amongst whom is of course to be reckoned
your open-minded Correspondent, was quickened by some <i>foie gras</i>,
and
rose to the highest pitch over a <i>salmi</i> of woodcocks, which even
Martingale admitted to be no end of good, although the best woodcocks in
the world were to be shot on the governor's manors in Lincolnshire.
Protocol here drank the health of the <i>chef</i> in a glass of <span
class="smcap">Cliquot's</span>
champagne amid general applause.</p>

<p>Your Correspondent is aware of the painful effect that would be
produced
on your readers, condemned to drag on a miserable existence on the
indigestible products of an English kitchen, if he were to enumerate and
describe the dishes that completed the repast&#8212;all light, savoury,
succulent, and nourishing. But why, he begs to ask, is it, that with
confessedly inferior materials a French artist can make up a dinner, and
a good one, where an Anglo Saxon cook only furnishes instruments of
stomachic torture? The fact is certain and the answer plain. A Frenchman
considers his occupation as an art and throws his soul into it. Success
is his ambition and, when achieved, his pride, and he pleases himself
when he pleases you. Compare his enlightened enthusiasm with the view
<span class="smcap">Mariar</span> or <span class="smcap">Soosan</span>
takes of her <i>métier</i>. Think of the impenetrable
stupidity, the indolent unconscientiousness, the complacent conceit, and
the obstinacy which hardens the hearts towards us of that matron and
that maid, and by their hands infuses death into the pot. O <span
class="smcap">Mariar</span>! O
<span class="smcap">Soosan</span>! be wise in time, learn your business,
 and be not slothful
therein; listen to a voice of warning from a foreign strand, lest the
day arrive when Missus is compelled to descend into the kitchen as
Missuses used to do in times gone by, and your empire over your
employers be broken up once and for ever.</p>

<p>The generous produce of a Burgundian autumn flamed in our glasses,
loosening the tongue and not blunting the wit. The effect was varied and
delightful. Old <span class="smcap">Martingale</span>, who had been very
 hard on the Lancers of the
Guard, admitted that in a campaign the French cavalry might be awkward
customers. <span class="smcap">De Faulter</span> ceased his allusions to
 the card-playing at the
Cercle, and his coups at <span class="smcap">Norris's</span>. <span
class="smcap">Ortolan</span> showed that he could talk on
other subjects than gastronomy, and <span class="smcap">De Courcy</span>
 was civil to <span class="smcap">Sheffield
Higson</span>, who, on the other hand, abstained from enumerating his
acquaintances among that aristocracy with whose utter worthlessness and
degradation he was so much impressed. Your Correspondent, who is always
pleasant and equable, was, if possible, more so than usual, and in the
intervals of his brilliant sallies, added by acute observation to those
stores of limpid wisdom, whence he periodically dispenses to your
readers.</p>

<hr />

<h4>Something in a Name after all.</h4>

<p>We see by the French papers, that an umbrella called <i>The Mushroom</i>
 has
been lately patented in Paris. We are not aware what new peculiarity of
construction its inventor has discovered, but we think the the name he
has selected is a highly appropriate one, and might with exceeding
fitness be applied, not to his alone, but to umbrellas generally. For as
mushrooms naturally belong to that class of things which are "here
to-day and gone to-morrow," we think their name may very properly be
used to designate so fugitive a possession as an umbrella.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="smcap">Cranks and Crotchets.</span>&#8212;The introduction of
crank labour into gaols has
tended to corroborate the opinion, which is widely prevalent, that
prison disciplinarians are apt to be what is vulgarly called "cranky."</p>

<h2>GRAND DRAMATIC APRÈS DÉJEÛNER.</h2>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/146a.png" alt="S" class="cap" width="30%" />

<p class="cap_2">SINCE the practice of giving entertainments to those
who entertain the
public has been adopted by those who got up the recent <i>déjeûner</i>
to <span class="smcap">Mr.
G. V. Brooke</span>, it was determined by the friends of <span
class="smcap">Mr. Stentor</span>&#8212;the great
interpreter of <span class="smcap">Fitzball</span>&#8212;to invite that
gentleman to a grand Spanish
onion feast, which came off at the Cinder Cellars and Dust-hole of
harmony, near the New Cut, Lambeth.</p>
</div>

<p>The room was hung with some of the best specimens from the theatrical
gallery of <span class="smcap">Marks</span>, and a magnificent portrait
of <span class="smcap">Hicks</span>, as <i>Ivanhoe</i>,
picked out with tinfoil, and filled in with real red satin, occupied the
centre of the wall over the seat of the Chairman. This masterly work of
art was appropriately supported on its right by the well-known engraving
of <span class="smcap">Mr. G. Almar</span>, as the <i>Knight of the
Cross</i>; and on its left by the
highly finished etching of <span class="smcap">Mr. Crowther</span>, as
the <i>Fiend of the
Sepulchre</i>. A group of Pantomime characters faced the door; and an
equestrian piece representing "<span class="smcap">Miss Woolford</span>
in her favourite act of
<i>The Reaper</i>," formed a pendant over the chimney-piece.</p>

<p>The supper was of the choicest kind, and embraced all the delicacies
of
the season that could be procured at the figure per head, which was
fixed at the moderate tariff of ninepence, in order to embrace as many
lovers of art&#8212;and onions&#8212;as possible. The <i>pièce de résistance</i> was
 a
bit of the roast beef of old England, to which Ireland contributed her
national potato, while Scotland sent her broth, and Wales was
represented by a magnificent Welch rabbit. Nor was the Continent
behind-hand in doing honour to the feast, for in peaceful proximity to
the onion of Spain, stood the roll of France, the sausage of Germany, a
flask of Lucca's luscious oil, and a few of the world-renowned sprouts
of Brussels. After the cloth&#8212;and the crumbs&#8212;had been removed, the
Chairman proposed the health of <span class="smcap">Mr. Stentor</span>,
who had made the voice of
the drama heard in the midst of the hoots of a threepenny gallery, and
who had fought more combats, assisted more defenceless females, unmasked
more villains, and danced more hornpipes than any man in Europe.</p>

<p>When the applause had subsided, <span class="smcap">Mr. Stentor</span>
 rose and modestly alluded to
his own proud position. He expressed the highest reverence for his art,
and declared that he felt almost awe-stricken when he trod the same
boards that had been indented by the honoured heels of <span
class="smcap">Hicks</span>, and looked
upon the same sky-borders that had been shaken by the screams of
<span class="smcap">Cartlitch</span>. He, <span class="smcap">Mr.
Stentor</span>, had had the honour of acting in the same
company with those great men, and he must say that he felt his bosom
swell when he remembered that the great <span class="smcap">Crowther</span>
 had hung upon it when,
as the tortured <i>Khan</i>, he lamented his "lost child;" and when he, <span
 class="smcap">Mr.
Stentor</span>, remembered that that "child" was no other than the
illustrious
<span class="smcap">Hicks</span>, he, <span class="smcap">Mr. Stentor</span>,
 felt that he had indeed, in the words of the
immortal <span class="smcap">Amherst</span> (J. H.), been "in goodly
company." He, <span class="smcap">Mr. Stentor</span>,
would not hope to equal these great men, nor would he ask that the
mantle of any of them should fall upon him; but if either of them should
have an old coat to spare, he did humbly ask that he might be allowed to
aspire to wear it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Stentor's</span> speech was received with the
 most enthusiastic clatter of
pint pots, which lasted for several minutes.</p>

<p>The Chairman then pronounced a most impressive eulogium on <span
class="smcap">Widdicomb</span>,
which was received in solemn silence.</p>

<p>This was responded to by a <span class="smcap">Shaksperian</span>
jester and clown to the ring, the
friend and adviser of <span class="smcap">Widdicomb</span>, who, among
other advice, advised him to
sit still and say nothing.</p>

<p>The Chairman, in the course of the evening, observed that "the drama
could never be in a decline while it had the support of such lungs as
those of his friend <span class="smcap">Stentor</span>."</p>

<p>After the health of <span class="smcap">Mr. Biddles</span>, of the
Bower Saloon, who acknowledged
the compliment with a neat nod, the party broke up at a late hour.</p>

<h2>THE LORD MAYOR'S SHOW FOR 1853!</h2>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/146b.png" alt="W" class="cap" width="35%" />

<p class="cap_3">WE perfectly agree with <span class="smcap">Mr.
Alderman Sidney</span>&#8212;the Lord Mayor elect&#8212;that
the great civic show of the Ninth of November is a vital element in our
social and commercial life. <span class="smcap">Whittington's</span> cat
 still purrs encouragingly
down generations. <span class="smcap">Walworth's</span> dagger is a
bright and keen realty; and not
the air-drawn blade that the utility-mongers would make of it. The
influence of the Lord Mayor's Show is no doubt felt in the remotest
parts of this island. The rumbling of the wheels of the state coach is
heard in the dreams of youthful sleepers a-bed, it may be, in garrets at
the Land's End. <span class="smcap">Alderman Sidney</span> feels all the
 poetry of this; therefore
the City of London is safe in his enthusiastic keeping.</p>
</div>

<p>But <span class="smcap">Mr. Alderman Sidney</span>&#8212;if we may believe a
 very general
report&#8212;proposes to endow the Show with a purpose of instruction. He
will inform outward bravery with an inward teaching. Thus, as a
prosperous tea-merchant, the new Lord Mayor will have a new state coach
built and ornamented as a magnificent tea-chest upon wheels; and will
further have his coachman and footmen drest after the approved fashion
of <span class="smcap">Tien-Te</span>, in remote but no less sincere
compliment to Young China,
<i>vice</i> Old China chipped, cracked, and falling to pieces.</p>

<hr />

<h4>Who is the Miscreant that sent us the following?</h4>

<p>As we know that the Russians require oleaginous food, is it not
possible
that, after devouring Turkey, the Czar may take a fancy to "Greece?"
Should he do so, is it not probable that "<span class="smcap">Genuine
Russian Bear's Greece</span>"
will no longer be a fiction?</p>

<h4>The Dream of a Bagpipe.</h4>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Earl of Aberdeen</span>, at the late Privy
Council, looked very much
pressed and flattened. It is said that, for some weeks past, the noble
Earl has suffered a nightly dream, in which he believes himself turned
to a bagpipe, with the <span class="smcap">Emperor of Russia</span>,
horned and tailed, playing
upon him.</p>

<h2>QUESTIONABLE ADVERTISEMENTS.</h2>

<p>The present mode of advertising seems to be by asking a question and,
from the general use of the process, we presume that the questioning is
found to answer. Somebody asks us every day, "Who would be without a
dressing case?" and another attempts to tickle our vanity by addressing
to us the inquiry, "Do you keep livery servants?" and suggesting to us
the <i>éclat</i> of an imaginary retinue. Another wants to know, "Why
pay
more than sixteen shillings for your trowsers?"&#8212;a question we hardly
like to dwell upon, for it presents to our mind the still more
interesting question, "Why pay anything at all, and why not victimise
your tailor?"</p>

<p>Talking of advertisements reminds us of one which daily offers to dye
our hair, including the whole head for a crown, and our whiskers for "a
shilling upwards." It would be important to know how far "upwards" we
could have our whiskers dyed for that moderate sum, as it would be
awkward to have them a rich Prussian blue about the jaw, a piebald in
the middle, and a good old natural grey on the cheek-bone. The same
accommodating person, who promises to dye us permanently for five
shillings, offers, if we don't like the look of ourselves when we've
been regularly done, to give us our money back again. This would be but
a sorry compensation for one who had exchanged the simplicity of nature
for the variegated hues of art, and who, in the hope of becoming once
more the youthful beau, had qualified himself for the part of the
rainbow. Before, standing the "hazard of the dye," we, like <span
class="smcap">Richard the
Third</span>, had rather see "<span class="smcap">Hastings's</span>
head," or anybody else's head, a month
after the operation.</p>

<h2>THE INN-FLUENZA.</h2>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/149.png" alt="W" class="cap" width="35%" />

<p class="cap_3">WE have had our attention called to a complaint which,
it seems, has
long been prevalent throughout the kingdom, although but little notice
hitherto has publicly been taken of it. It threatens now, however, to
become as prolific a source of correspondence as the Cholera; and
scarcely a <i>Times</i> passes, without at least a column of "Constant
Readers" on the subject.</p>
</div>

<p>We are not aware if a specific name has as yet been found for it; but
 we
think it may be best described, perhaps, as a sort of Inn-fluenza,
although it certainly in some degree resembles also a remittent fever,
seeing that the sufferers cannot generally make progress without a
remittance. And it partakes still further of a febrile character, since
it usually is attended with irritation in the patient.</p>

<p>Of the symptoms which lead to it, perhaps the most painful is a
species
of opthalmia, which commonly afflicts the patient with the most
distressing ocular delusions. He has been even known, under its
influence, to declare that he can see only a pint of wine in a decanter,
which his attendants have assured him contains a bottle; and candles,
which he similarly has been told are wax, he has frequently been found
unable to distinguish from composite. The sense of taste, too, it seems,
is similarly affected. When offered pale ale, the patient not
unfrequently will pronounce it to be swipes; and in some cases he has
actually mistaken that for Cape, which is warranted, and even charged
for, as Madeira.</p>

<p>We trust that the urgency of this complaint being now admitted,
efficient means will be at once devised to stop it. There is little
doubt, we think, that the sufferers hitherto have been bled too freely,
and another course of treatment should be certainly adopted. We do not
generally advocate the use of the knife, but in this complaint
decidedly, wherever any person is attacked by the symptoms which may
lead to it, we do not know if we can well prescribe a surer remedy than
cutting.</p>

<h2>RANDOM RECORDS OF A RUN THROUGH CERTAIN CONTINENTAL COUNTRIES.</h2>

<center>(<i>By the Author of "All the Great Metropolises".</i>)</center>

<blockquote><p>[We rather think the following letter has reached us by
mistake, and
must have been intended for one of our morning contemporaries.
However, we print it.&#8212;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p></blockquote>

<center>LETTER XLIII.</center>

<p>While I am on the Continent I feel quite different to what I do when I
am on an island. The sensation that if you leave one country you can
immediately go into another, without the intervention of what <span
class="smcap">Lord Byron</span>
has so beautifully called the Blue Ocean, (although the ocean or sea is
not always blue, but often green) between the two neighbourhoods,
produces a curious effect upon my idiosyncrasy. At the same time I must
confess that this metaphysical feeling does not apply to Paris, because
that city is in the centre of a large country, and if I wished to leave
it (which at present I do not), I should have to traverse a considerable
extent of territory.</p>

<p>Yesterday I visited the Madelaine, which is a church, and stands near
the Boulevards, and the front looks towards the Place de la Concorde, a
locality which has also had various other names, which, if I knew them,
as I am "free to confess" (as they say in a certain place which I have
already immortalised) I do not, would naturally suggest to the mind a
long train of instructive historical thoughts, although as the
Madelaine, if <span class="smcap">Galignani's</span> <i>Guide</i> may be
 trusted, was not built until
after the principal events connected with the Place de la Concorde had
occurred, to remember them here would be a case of <i>post hoc et
prompter
hoc</i> (I translate for the benefit of the fair sex&#8212;"because you are
here
you are prompted to think of that there,") and as I am travelling to
instruct myself and my readers, I wish to avoid <i>persiflage</i>. The
Madelaine is a building which has cost considerable sums of money, and
it is a remarkable coincidence that it is Greek in style though intended
for <i>Roman</i> Catholic worship, but such are the anomalies and
anachronisms which strike the intelligent traveller. The <i>façade</i>,
or
altar-piece, is painted in very bright colours, with mythological
allusions to the <span class="smcap">Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte</span>,
and other well-known
individuals. The effect of the exterior is something like that of the
Licensed Victuallers' Asylum at Woking Buzzard, but I think in many
respects inferior to that worthy and laudable institution, of which an
Englishman (I do not particularly refer to a talented, gifted, and
irascible correspondent) is so justly proud. I only staid five minutes;
service was not being performed, and there was no person in the church
but myself, but this was enough to inspire me with the utmost contempt
for the mummeries of the Roman Catholic creed, and with pity for the
blinded and unenlightened individuals who indulge therein.</p>

<p>The day being fine, or as they say in France, <i>ce est une beau
journal</i>,
I lounged along the Boulevards, and remarked that human nature was the
same in every climate. I then went down the Rue de la Paix&#8212;you will
observe that I am now quite familiar with the old parts of the City of
Paris&#8212;and after some turnings came to the Cathedral of Notre Dame,
which is certainly fine, although devoted to a false religion, which,
however, does not alter the architecture, and I hope I am too candid not
to draw the distinction between the external and the internal aspects of
an edifice. To adopt a metaphor, the sign of a tavern may be well
painted, although the beer sold within may not be good; but in saying
this, I wish to be understood to speak generally, and not with reference
to any particular establishment, far less to swell that illiberal cry
against hotel-keepers (many of whom are most worthy and honourable men)
which my antagonist&#8212;whom it is my mission to crush&#8212;in Printing House
Square continually raises.</p>

<p>But, <i>revenions a nous moutions</i>, ("to return to business") I
was
greatly pleased, or shall I say amused, with a highly dramatic scene
which occurred in the course of my walk. I shall never forget it, and it
may take its place "in this distracted orb" (<span class="smcap">Shakspere's</span>
 <i>Hamlet</i>)
beside that other joke, which, as I have already told my readers, will
throw me into paradoxes of laughter at any hour or time. Wake me and
tell me the house is on fire, assure me there is an earthquake, let me
hear that a printer's unpardonable carelessness has made a newspaper
under my charge say a reverend clergyman reached before <span
class="smcap">Prince Albert</span>
instead of preached before H. R. H., and that the Court refuses to
receive my published apology; still, if you tell me the joke in
question, I shall laugh. But I think the following dialogue is as rich
as the other, <i>Arcades ambo</i>, (the fair sex must excuse me if I do
not
translate this). I saw a respectable gentleman's handkerchief protruding
from his coat pocket, and knowing the disagreeableness of finding that
humble but useful article missing, especially in the influenza period, I
thought I would waive ceremony, and though unintroduced, suggest to him
the advisability of a precautionary measure. So, touching my hat with
some playfulness, I said, "<i>Monsieur, vous voulez perdre votre
parapluie</i>." (I must not translate this, or the joke will be lost.)</p>

<p>"<i>Ah!</i>" he replied, adding, after a pause, "<i>Bah!</i>"</p>

<p>But as he did not replace his handkerchief, I, who am not easily
daunted, returned to the attack.</p>

<p>"<i>Mais, Monsieur, vous n'attendez pas a moi.</i>" (Sir, you do not
attend
to me.)</p>

<p>"<i>Diable!</i>" he exclaimed, impatiently. As I never permit any of
our own
correspondents to use this word, I shall not break my own laws by
rendering it into the vernacular.</p>

<p>A compatriot of my own here came up, and with the sportiveness
allowable
to intimacy, said,</p>

<p>"What's the row?"</p>

<p>I explained that I had given the French gentleman a caution as to his
<i>parapluie</i>, to which I pointed as sticking out of his pocket.</p>

<p>"That's his <i>mouchoir</i>," said my friend, laughing heartily, as
did the
gentleman when the mistake was explained to him, and we all took off our
hats to one another. These little amenities cost nothing, but yet may be
bright oases on the ordinary stream of the battle of life.</p>

<p>I must reserve until to-morrow my narrative of the taking of the
Bastille, which naturally occurred to me as I gazed upon the column in
the Place Vendôme, and I shall probably offer some instructive
observations upon the literature and religion of the country in which I
now find myself. But I can truly say, "England" (which includes
Scotland, and also poor Ireland) "with all thy faults, my heart still
turns to thee," a thought which must comfort those countries during my
temporary absence.</p>

<h2>FESTIVITIES IN SOUTHWARK.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">A splendid</span> banquet was yesterday given by <span
 class="smcap">Messrs. Pue</span> and <span class="smcap">Phitt</span>
to their
friends and connexions, to commemorate what may be termed the coming of
age of their establishment; the extensive bone-boiling and
horse-slaughtering concern, and catgut manufactory, situated in a
densely populated part of the above district: which, having now arrived
at the standing of 30 years, is exempt from the operation of the
Nuisances Removal Act.</p>

<p>Dinner was served in a large shed on the premises, fitted up for the
occasion, having been decorated with much attention to taste, and
plentifully sprinkled with chloride of lime in equally judicious regard
to smell.</p>

<p>The usual loyal toasts having been dispensed with, and "Our Noble
Selves" substituted in their place, the senior partner proposed the
toast of the evening. He said he was glad, in times like the present,
when alarmists were making such efforts to lead people by the nose in a
crusade against everybody who gave the slightest inconvenience to that
organ, to see himself, and his friend at the other extremity of the
table, surrounded by so numerous and respectable an assembly of
well-wishers. He was proud of the support of the strong minds that
despised a squeamish agitation, and of the strong stomachs&#8212;the two
always went together&#8212;that asserted themselves in meeting to afford that
support in that place. The interest that he and his partner had the
honour of representing might be called one of the Institutions of
Southwark; and they prided themselves upon the fact that their premises
were, as a wag had observed, among the peculiar fetors of the locality.
The odour of profit was pleasant, in the opinion of a wise man, no
matter what the profit was made out of, and the surrounding district was
rich in effluvia, and he hoped no dainty legislation would ever
impoverish it. Bones were not boiled&#8212;dogsmeat was not made&#8212;catgut was
not manufactured&#8212;with lavender-water. But what was called a perfume was
often more unhealthy than the reverse. Flowers, for instance, were
considered by the faculty bad for a sick room; and on the other hand,
what could be more wholesome than physic, and what more nasty? The
salubrity of the atmosphere they were then inhaling, was proved by the
fact that himself and his family had been breathing it for the last
thirty years; and that led him to the toast he was about to propose. The
establishment which they were met to celebrate the prosperity of, had
now completed the thirtieth year of its existence. It had, in fact,
attained its majority, and was now no longer under that control that an
infant business of the same nature is subject to. The monster nuisance,
as it had been invidiously called, was no longer amenable to the
Nuisances Removal Act. The young Giant was out of his nonage; and those
who wished to grapple with him must do it in the Court of Quarter
Sessions&#8212;where he defied them. He would now then give them the young
Giant's good health; they would drink, if they pleased, Perpetuity to
the Premises, and Success to Sulphuretted Hydrogen and Ammonia.</p>

<p>The toast was drunk with all the odours.</p>

<p>The other member of the firm briefly expressed his thanks for the
kind
and enthusiastic manner in which the company had responded to his worthy
partner; which, he declared, quite delighted his old bones.</p>

<p>After a series of other anti-sanitary toasts and sentiments, the
company
separated at a late hour in an excited state, having, as a facetious
gentleman remarked with a strong emphasis on the first syllable of the
epithet, partaken of an entertainment that was truly <i>sump</i>-tuous.</p>

<h2>THE ETRUSCAN PATTERN.</h2>

<p>We are informed that a communication of an interesting nature has
been
made to the Tuscan Government in reference to the imprisonment of <span
class="smcap">Miss
Cunninghame</span> for giving away a Bible and a <i>Pilgrim's Progress</i>.
 Through
the <span class="smcap">Hon. Mr. Scarlett</span>, acting as Chargé
d'Affaires in the temporary
absence of <span class="smcap">Sir Henry Bulwer</span>, <span
class="smcap">Lord Aberdeen</span> is said to have requested the
opinion of the <span class="smcap">Grand Duke Leopold</span> and his
Cabinet respecting a measure
of great importance in regard to the principle of toleration,
contemplated very seriously by <span class="smcap">Her Majesty's</span>
Ministers. The projected
enactment which has thus been submitted to the consideration of the
Tuscan Sovereign and his advisers is based on the principle whereon is
also founded the article in their penal code under which <span
class="smcap">Miss
Cunninghame</span> has been incarcerated. It treats the attempt to
convert any
person from the State religion as a crime against the State, and
inflicts imprisonment with hard labour for that offence. Under its
operation any Roman Catholic, convicted of making a present to a member
of the Established Church of a "<i>Garden of the Soul</i>," or a
crucifix,
will be tried for sedition and <span class="smcap">Cardinal Wiseman</span>
 will inevitably be sent
to the treadmill.</p>

<p class="cap_3">OLIVES are to be grown in Edinburgh. We rejoice to hear
 the news. The
Scotch have always been distinguished for meekness and (after breakfast)
even mealy-mouthedness. They have, nevertheless, been shamefully
libelled by history. The national spirit has been designated the
<i>perfervidum genium Scotorum!</i> No such thing. <span class="smcap">Caledonia</span>
 was ever mild as
milk: in the time even of <span class="smcap">Agricola</span>, it was

not melt in her mouth. This meek, pacific quality of Scotland has been
wickedly disguised and libelled, but <span class="smcap">Cobden</span>
and <span class="smcap">Bright</span> have resolved to
vindicate the truth. Eagles never did breed in Scotland&#8212;they were only
doves, sucking-doves, of a larger size. And as for the thistle, with
that hostile, spiteful, unbrotherly motto, <i>Nemo me impune
lacessit</i>,&#8212;Scotland shall henceforth assume as her floral type the
simple "gowan fine."</p>

appropriate beauty of imagery and plenteousness of fare. We have

and brilliant manner, further illustrate the uses and beauties of <span

<p>For ourselves, we say, long flourish the olive-tree! But is now the
precise season to plant it in the soil of Scotland?</p>

<p>Courteous invitations have been sent to the <span class="smcap">Emperors
 of Russia and
Austria</span>, to be present either in their Imperial persons or by
ambassador. However, up to the time of our going to press, no answer had
been received; and we thought it, perhaps, useless to wait for it.</p>

<h4>"Woodman! Spare that Joke."</h4>

<p>A new Work has been recently published under the quaint title of "<i>The
Book
 of the Axe</i>." We do not know whether it is an illustrated volume,
but the "<i>Book of the Axe</i>" would seem to have missed its aim,
unless
the "cuts on wood" are numerous.</p>

<h2>A TRANSPORTED AUDIENCE.</h2>

<p>Transportation, as a penalty for crime, has been abolished by law:
but
transportation, by way of amusement, is still carried on, and <span
class="smcap">Mr. Henry
Russell</span>&#8212;familiarly known as the original "maniac," he having
obtained
an injunction against a second-hand "maniac" who had infringed a
copyright by seeing them "dancing, dancing, dancing, in the hall"&#8212;has
been causing some of his audience to be literally transported with
delight by presenting them with free passages to America. This is all
very well, and very liberal, no doubt, but a passage to America may
sometimes prove more free than welcome.</p>

<p>We recollect a recent instance of a quiet old gentleman from the country
having strolled into a theatre, where he found a "popular vocalist"
pumping away at the "<i>Ship on Fire</i>" with all his lungs, and the old
gentleman was about to quit the theatre at the end of the performance
when he was suddenly seized, dragged on to the stage, exhibited to
public view, and loudly cheered as the happy winner of "a free passage
to America." To appear ungrateful for a boon which seemed to be thought
so enviable was impossible, and the poor old gentleman was obliged to
give his name and address on the spot, to enter into arrangements for
meeting the ship at Liverpool, and pledge himself to an emigration which
would separate him from a capital business, a devoted wife, and an
affectionate family. The feelings of that wife and family may be
conceived when they found by the next day's paper&#8212;received by the
early morning mail two hundred miles from London&#8212;that the husband
and father had so far forgotten the ties of home and kindred as to have
become the subject of "a free passage to America." It is true that,
after a frightful nightmare, in which he heard a wild chorus of "Cheer,
boys, cheer," interrupted by moans of "Ha! 'tis the night watch!" with
occasional shrieks of "I am not mad! I am not mad!" he rose with a
determination to relinquish his precious prize, and resigned to some
more appreciating hands his "free passage to America."</p>

<h2>VERY GOOD OF THE POPE.</h2>

<p>The Pope, according to his frequent custom, has recently caused
prayers
to be offered in all Continental Catholic churches, for the conversion
of England. This is very good of him, though it may be very unnecessary.
The <span class="smcap">Pope</span> declares&#8212;sorrowingly&#8212;that this
England, "once the island of
the blessed," has been "for a long while past caught in the errors of
heresy"&#8212;"has fallen from the true belief,"&#8212;and is oppressed by "dark,
false teaching, which keeps it from the knowledge of the truth." All of
which evils His Holiness prays may be put away from us, that we may all
see the true light, which is the <span class="smcap">Pope's</span>
eye&#8212;all salute the true faith,
which is the <span class="smcap">Pope's</span> toe. We repeat, however,
that we object not to the
prayers of the <span class="smcap">Pope's</span> Church; but we do most
vehemently object to the
bolts and bars with which such supplications are wont to be associated.
For instance, we have no objection that the <span class="smcap">Duke of
Tuscany</span> should pray
for the conversion of <span class="smcap">Miss Cunninghame</span>, but
we do object&#8212;and might feel
disposed to urge such objection from an iron mouth&#8212;that the <span
class="smcap">Grand Duke</span>
should turn the lady from her free home to an Italian dungeon. Let the
<span class="smcap">Duke</span> pray as much as he will; but only
pray&#8212;not <i>prey</i>.</p>

<h2>RUSSIAN "MOUCHES" IN EDINBURGH.</h2>

<p>The daily papers tell us that&#8212;</p>

<blockquote><p>"The clouds of small black flies which were observed in
many places
of the island about a fortnight or three weeks ago, again presented
themselves on Wednesday morning in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh."</p></blockquote>

<p>These black flies have&#8212;we understand upon good authority&#8212;preceded <span
 class="smcap">Mr.
Elihu Burritt</span> from Russia: and are, indeed, only another evidence
 of the
magical influence of the harmonious blacksmith. These black flies
were&#8212;only two months ago&#8212;wasps, Russian wasps, encountered by <span
class="smcap">Elihu</span> in
the environs of St. Petersburg. He was on horseback, when his horse's
foot sinking into a wasp's nest, brought a cloud of the destructive
insects about the head of the traveller. Every wasp had his sting out
when&#8212;<span class="smcap">Mr. Burritt</span> delivered himself of one of
those marvellous orations
which it had been his mission to deliver to the <span class="smcap">Czar's</span>
 bondmen. In
twenty minutes, the eloquent peacemaker had talked every armed wasp into
a harmless small black fly. Thus, can there be any doubt that the peace
orators of the North will, in like manner, talk the Russian army out of
its bayonets?</p>

<h2>MEETING OF THE RABBITS.</h2>

<p>Last week was held a meeting of certain rabbits in a box in the
Zoological Gardens. The meeting, it must be confessed, was not very
numerous, but extremely respectable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Doublesmut</span> took the chair, and briefly
 opened the proceedings. He
said that they would improve the happy accident of their meeting into an
enduring advantage. He thought that the time had arrived for the whole
nation of rabbits to raise themselves in the scale of creation; by
cultivating a deeper trust and wider confidence with the animal world
about them. He must lament, while he confessed, that he had been brought
up in the fear and horror of foxes, weasels, stoats, polecats,
sparrow-hawks, and so forth. But, for his part, he believed that the
time was come when the whole rabbit people might live in love and amity
and perfect trust with all around them. It was mean; it was a moral
cowardice to distrust either fox or weasel: they, poor things! like
illiterate rabbits, had been the victims of ignorance and prejudice; but
in these days, everybody might embrace everybody. Yes, he felt his heart
expand towards all created things, and&#8212;</p>

<p>&#8212;And the rest of the speech was cut short; for the boa-constrictor&#8212;in
whose house the rabbits had met, and over whose coils they had hopped
and run&#8212;the boa, in the twinkling of an eye, had <span class="smcap">Mr.
 Doublesmut</span> in his
jaws; and in two minutes deposited body and bones in his throat.</p>

<hr />

<h2>A LUNDY FOOT LINGUIST.</h2>

<p>The promotion of talent is always gratifying, even when that talent
is
employed on the side of opponents. <span class="smcap">Mr. Lucas</span>
deserves a reward, which we
should like to see him get, for having lately distinguished himself.
Among the Hibernian intelligence, the other day, it was reported that,
at a tenant-right meeting, a <span class="smcap">Dr. M'Knight</span>
having accused him of an act
of treachery to the cause, the honourable gentleman declared the
doctor's statement to be an "unmitigated lie." <span class="smcap">Mr.
Lucas</span> has often
distinguished himself by the use of similar expressions; and what is
remarkable, he has not distinguished himself by anything else, except by
a veneration of the <span class="smcap">Pope</span> and a hatred of his
Protestant fellow
subjects&#8212;if his hatred for Protestantism stops there. But it is
precisely the limited nature of the ability which he has displayed which
entitles him to preferment: and we are sure we speak the sentiments of
all moderate politicians when we say that <span class="smcap">Dr.
Newman's</span> "Catholic"
University cannot do less than appoint the Hon. Member Professor of the
Vulgar Tongue.</p>

<p>We would also commend <span class="smcap">Mr. Lucas's</span> merits
to the attention of <span class="smcap">Her
Majesty's</span> advisers. We might as well have diplomatic relations
with
Rome, as with any other of the absurd and semi-barbarous Governments to
which we send an envoy. Let those relations then, be established, and
our vituperative ex-friend despatched as ambassador to the <span
class="smcap">Pope</span>. The
only fear is that the salary which, of course, would be attached to the
appointment would stop his mouth, or, at least, deprive his eloquence of
that only quality which renders it remarkable&#8212;that peculiar strength of
language without which it would be wholly unadorned. That this would not
much signify one way or the other is not quite true. It is of some
consequence to the community at large to be presented, from time to
time, with an example of the effects of popish bigotry on the human
feelings and intellect, as afforded by the unrestrained rhetoric of <span
 class="smcap">Mr.
Lucas</span>.</p>

<h2>HOW WE ARE OFF FOR SOAP!</h2>

<p>If any one asks us how we are off for soap it is pleasant to be able
to
answer the question in the most satisfactory manner. We happen to be
extremely well off for soap, in consequence of the kindness of some
eccentric individuals who are always sending us by post certain
penn'orths of specimens of saponaceous matter, with which they invite us
to shave ourselves. We have lately received in a letter a bit of
something which we are told will cover our face with "a lather like
thick white paint, over which the razor will glide;" but as we don't
want a razor to glide <i>over</i> our beard, we hesitate to try the
experiment. The gratuitous soap is accompanied by the prospectus of a
perfume, which "never becomes faint," and a preparation for the hair,
which makes it "soft and glossy for ever." We are quite sure that the
individual who sent the announcement to us can have no notion of the
disorderly haycock which does duty on the top of our poll for a head of
hair, or he would never undertake to render it "permanently," or even
for one moment "soft and glossy."</p>

<h4>THE TWO DROMIOS.
</h4></div>

<hr />

<h2>BULLY BOTTOM.</h2>

<p>Bully <i>Bottom</i> is, in truth, "translated" by <span class="smcap">Mr.
 Phelps</span>. Translated from
matter-of-fact into poetic humour&#8212;translated from the commonplace
tradition of the playhouse to a thing subtly grotesque&#8212;rarely, and
heroically whimsical. A bully <i>Bottom</i> of the old, allowed sort,
makes
up his face&#8212;even as the rustic wag of a horse-collar&#8212;to goggle and
grin; and is as like to the sweet bully of <span class="smcap">Phelps</span>&#8212;bears
 the same
relation in art to the <i>Bottom</i> of Sadler's Wells&#8212;as the sign-post
portrait on the village green to a head, vital by a few marvellous dots
and touches of <span class="smcap">Richard Doyle</span>. In these days
we know of no such
translation! Translate a starveling Welsh curate into a Bishop of
London, and <span class="smcap">Phelps's</span> translation of <i>Bottom</i>
 the weaver shall still
remain a work of finer art, and&#8212;certainly to all humanising intents of
man-solacing humour&#8212;of far richer value. We have had, plentiful as
French eggs, translations of facile, delicate French into clumsy,
hobbling British; and now, as some amends, we have <i>Bottom</i>
translated
by <span class="smcap">Phelps</span> from dull tradition into purest
airiest <span class="smcap">Shakspere</span>. <span class="smcap">Mr.
Phelps</span>
has not painted, dabbed, we should say, the sweet bully with the old
player's old hare's-foot; but has taken the finest pencil, and, with a
clean, sharp, fantastic touch, has rendered <i>Bottom</i> a living
weaver&#8212;a
weaver whose brain is marvellously woven, knitted up, with self-opinion.</p>

<p>Now this, we take to be the true, breathing notion of <span
class="smcap">Shakspere</span>, and
this notion has entered the belief of the actor, and become a living
thing. <i>Bottom</i> is of conceit all-compact. Conceit flows in his
veins&#8212;is ever swelling, more or less, in his heart; covers him from
scalp to toes, like his skin. And it is this beautiful, this most
profitable quality&#8212;this human coin, self-opinion, which, however
cracked, and thin, and base, may be put off as the real thing by the
unfailing heroism of the utterer&#8212;it is this conceit that saves <i>Bottom</i>
from a world of wonderment when he finds himself the leman dear, clipp'd
by the Queen of Faery. <i>Bottom</i> takes the love&#8212;the doting of
<i>Titania</i>&#8212;as he would take the commanded honey-bag of the
red-lipped
humble-bee&#8212;as something sweet and pleasant, but nought to rave about.
He is fortified by his conceit against any surprise of the most
bountiful fortune: self-opinion turns fairy treasures into rightful
wages. And are there not such <i>Bottoms</i>&#8212;not writ upon the paper
Athens
of the poet; not swaggering in a wood watered of ink-drops&#8212;but such
sweet bullies in brick and mortar London&#8212;<i>Bottoms</i> of Fortune, that
 for
sport's sake plays <i>Puck</i>? The ingenuous <i>Bottom</i> of the play
has this
distinction from the <i>Bottoms</i> of the real, human world&#8212;he, for the
time, wears his ass's head with a difference; that is, he shows the
honest length of his ears, and does not, and cannot abate the show of a
single hair. His head is outwardly all ass: there is with him no
reservation soever.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Phelps</span> has the fullest and the deepest
 sense of the asinine
qualities of <i>Bottom</i> from the beginning. For <i>Bottom</i> wants
not the
ass's head to mark him ass: the ass is in <i>Bottom's</i> blood and
brain;
<i>Puck</i> merely fixes the outward, vulgar type significant of the
inward
creature. When <i>Bottom</i> in the first scene desires to be <i>Wall</i>,
 and
<i>Moonshine</i>, and <i>Lion</i>, his conceit brays aloud, but brays
with
undeveloped ears. But herein is the genius of our actor. The traditional
bully <i>Bottom</i> is a dull, stupid, mouthing ass, with no force save
in
his dullness. <i>Bottom</i>, as played by <span class="smcap">Mr. Phelps</span>,
 is an ass with a
vehemence, a will, a vigour in his conceit, but still an ass. An ass
that fantastically kicks his heels to the right and left, but still ass.
An ass that has the most prolonged variations of his
utterance&#8212;nevertheless, it is braying, and nothing better. And there is
great variety in braying. We never heard two asses bray alike.
Listen&#8212;it may be the season of blossoming hawthorns&#8212;and asses salute
asses. In very different tones, with very different cadence, will every
ass make known the yearning, the aspiration that is within him. We speak
not frivolously, ignorantly, on this theme; for in our time we have
heard very many asses. And so return we to the <i>Bottom</i> of merry
Islington&#8212;to the Golden Ass of Sadler's Wells.</p>

<p>That ass has opened the playhouse season of 1853-4 very
musically&#8212;would
we could think hopefully, and with prophetic promise. At present,
however, <i>Bottom</i> is the master-spirit: and, in these days of
dramatic
<i>pardonnez-mois</i>, it is a little comforting&#8212;not that we are given
to
the sanguine mood in things theatrical&#8212;to know that folks are found
ready to make jocund pilgrimage to Sadler's Wells, where a man with a
real vital love for his art has now for many seasons made his theatre a
school; and more, has never wanted attentive, reverent, grateful
scholars. In this, <span class="smcap">Mr. Phelps</span> has been a
national school-master;
and&#8212;far away from the sustaining, fructifying beams of the Court&#8212;for
hitherto our <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> has not visited our <span
 class="smcap">Burridge</span>&#8212;has popularly
taught the lessons left to England by <span class="smcap">Shakspere</span>&#8212;legacies
 everlasting as
her cliffs.</p>

<p>As yet, <span class="smcap">Her Majesty</span> has not journied to
the Wells. But who knows, how
soon that "great fairy" may travel thither, to do grace to bully
<i>Bottom</i>! If so, let <span class="smcap">Mr. Phelps</span>&#8212;if he
can&#8212;still heighten his manner on
his awakening from that dream. Let him&#8212;if he can&#8212;more subtly mingle
wonderment with struggling reason, reason wrestling with wonder to get
the better of the mystery!</p>

<blockquote><p>"I have had a dream&#8212;past the wit of man to say what dream
 it truly
was!&#8212;Man is but an ass, if he go about to expound this dream.
Methought I was&#8212;there is no man can tell what! Methought I was, and
methought I had.&#8212;The eye of man hath not heard, the ear of man hath
not seen, man's hand is not able to taste, his tongue to conceive,
nor his heart to report, what my dream was."</p></blockquote>

<p>We do not think it in the wit or power of <span class="smcap">Mr.
Phelps</span>&#8212;under any newer
inspiration, to give a deeper, finer meaning to this than he has done.
But, if <span class="smcap">Her Majesty</span> command the play, as a
loyal subject, he will
doubtless make the essay. In these words, <i>Bottom</i>&#8212;as rendered by
the
actor&#8212;is taken away from the ludicrous; he is elevated by the mystery
that possesses him, and he affects our more serious sympathies, whilst
he forbids our laughter. One of the very, very few precious things of
the stage&#8212;of this starved time&#8212;is an Ass's head, as worn by the
manager of merrie Islington.</p>

<p>We hope, at least, the <span class="smcap">Queen</span> will command
that head to be brought&#8212;with
due solemnity&#8212;to Windsor Castle. Let <i>Bottom</i> be made to roar again
before <span class="smcap">Her Majesty</span>, the <span class="smcap">Prince</span>,
 the heir-apparent, and all the smaller
childhood royalties. Let <i>Bottom</i> be confronted with the picked of
the
Cabinet&#8212;the elect of Privy Councillors. And&#8212;as we have Orders of
Eagles and Elephants, why not the ingenuous out-speaking significance,
the Order of the Ass? As a timid beginning, we have the
Thistle&#8212;wherefore not the Ass himself?</p>

<p>In which case, the Order established, the <i>Bottom</i> of Sadler's
Wells
ought rightfully to be the Chancellor thereof.</p>

<hr />

<h2>SOMETHING IN A SIGN.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Romeo</span> would never have asked "What's in a
name?" if he had but lived to
take a tour in England, and become acquainted with the nomenclature of
some of our inns. To us there is hardly a sign in the kingdom which is
not thoroughly sign-ificant: and any traveller, we should think, who has
his mental eyes about him, may see at a glance outside the way in which
he will be taken in. Who, for instance, would expect to enter the jaws,
or doors, of a <i>Lion</i> without being bitten, or to get away from an
<i>Eagle</i> without considerable bleeding? A little matured, the <i>Lamb</i>
becomes decidedly indicative of fleecing; while every <i>Bear</i>, we
know,
is naturally prone to squeeze as many as he can lay his paws on. Roguery
in the <i>Fox</i> is what everybody looks for, and plucking and roasting
 are,
of course, inseparable from a <i>Goose and Gridiron</i>. Nor is the <i>Blue
Boar</i> an exception to the rule, for it most aptly symbolises your
complexion when you leave it: and no one, we should think, would enter a
<i>Green Man</i>, when reminded on the threshold of his verdancy in
doing so.</p>

<p>Of all our signs, however, perhaps there is none more suggestive than
the <i>Magpie and Stump</i>, which any one may see is merely a
contraction
for the far more significant <i>Magpie and Stump Up</i>.</p>

<hr />

<h4>The Hatchet.</h4>

<p>"Shall we never bury the hatchet?" asks <span class="smcap">Mr.
Cobden</span>. And <i>Punch</i> asks,
"How can the hatchet be buried, when the peacemakers themselves so often
throw it?"</p>

<h2>IMPROVEMENTS OF LONDON VERSUS THE IMPROVEMENTS OF PARIS.</h2>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/154.png" alt="S" class="cap" width="30%" />

<p class="cap_2">SOME attention having been lately called to the
increasing magnificence
of Paris, it is due to the national taste of this country to point out
the improvements that have been lately effected and are now in progress
in the British Metropolis.</p>
</div>

<p>To begin with Buckingham Palace; and indeed we may well say to
"begin"
with it, for we can scarcely hope to see it finished. Standing in front
of the Palace, we look upon the enclosure of the Park, and we feel a
national pride in stating that there has been an extensive addition to
the valuable collection of aquatic birds which absorb so much of the
attention&#8212;and the bread-crumbs&#8212;of the bystanders. Every one is
familiar with the fountain opposite the Palace, and the familiarity of
the public had been accompanied by a contempt which was perfectly
natural. This fountain, formerly consisting of a stone ginger-beer
bottle, standing in a round pie dish, has been removed, the operation
having served the double purpose of improving a work of Art, and giving
employment to one plumber, a bricklayer, and a bricklayer's labourer for
nearly a fortnight. This stroke of policy combined the advancement of
national taste with a propitiation of the working-class, or, at least,
of those members of it&#8212;three in all&#8212;who were engaged in the
transmogrification of the ginger-beer bottle in a pie dish complete to
the present substitute, which, though highly effective, is exceedingly
simple, and is, in fact, nothing but a plug-hole.</p>

<p>Turning our back upon this subterranean squirt, which we are happy to
do, we walk up to the gates of the Palace, where taste and industry are
at work in the form of a stone-mason, who is occupied in chipping the
resemblance of a bunch of <span class="smcap">Prince of Wales's</span>
feathers on the stone-work
to which the gates are appended. When this magnificent idea is realised
on all the gate-posts, the spectator, looking from the north, will have
no less than six feathers in his eye&#8212;a result that might be looked for
in vain in any other capital of Europe. Turning our gaze upwards to the
Palace, we are struck by the dazzling effect of several thousand pails
of whitewash which have been lavished on the front of the royal
residence, while, for the sake of contrast, the sides and back of the
building have been left in all their pristine dirtiness.</p>

<p>We will now proceed to the City, by Pall Mall; and, on our way, we
will
stop at the Ordnance Office where, as it is a public building, we will
see what public taste and public money have effected. The architect has,
with a boldness amounting to audacity, piled an extra attic on to each
of the two wings, thus producing a wondrous novelty of effect by making
the sides of the building considerably higher than the centre. Criticism
might, perhaps, complain of a rather too free use of the cowl&#8212;and,
indeed, of a rather startling variety of cowls&#8212;in the treatment of the
chimney-pots. Passing eastwards, and shutting our eyes&#8212;for obvious
reasons&#8212;as we traverse Trafalgar Square, we turn round when we reach
the Strand, and catch a glimpse of the pigtail of <span class="smcap">George
 the Third</span>
forming a sort of parallax to the Electric Clock, which is the star of
the neighbourhood. The first remarkable work of Art that greets us on
our way is the wooden figure of a Mandarin, which nods to us from the
window of a tea-dealer's; and this curious specimen of sculpture in wood
is faced by a remarkable piece of carving in the form of a joint of cold
meat in the cook's shop opposite. Finding ourselves eventually in the
City, we pass the end of Farringdon Street, pausing for a moment at the
Waithman Monument, and thinking that the artist who gave his head to
this block ought to have his head given to another.</p>

<p>But we now approach the more ambitious improvements that have been
effected in the City at an enormous cost, and we are struck with
astonishment at the bold effort that has been made by the architect of
the Manchester Warehouse on the right to destroy the effect of St.
Paul's, by raising up an ordinary brick structure to a considerable
height above the roof of the Cathedral, and thus suggesting the
recollection of the frog and the ox in the fable. The architect of the
Manchester Warehouse, who is some unknown "bird," has endeavoured to
swell himself out to the dimensions of a <span class="smcap">Wren</span>,
 and the result is, that
though he may have damaged the effect of St. Paul's, he has made his own
paltry pile ridiculous by its juxtaposition to the great metropolitan
monument.</p>

<p>From the sketch we have given it will be seen that we cannot be
charged
with doing nothing in the way of alteration to the Metropolis, but, on
the contrary, we are doing much that will give a lesson to Art by
teaching what to avoid, or, at all events, what would be better avoided.</p>

<h2>OUR TOURIST IN PARIS.&#8212;NO. 8.</h2>

<p>Frenchmen are accustomed to boast, and with reason, that Paris is the
best stranger's city in the world. If you were dropped from the skies
into the Place de la Bourse with nothing, as people say, but what you
stand upright in, in five minutes you might have the advantages of a
complete establishment. Under that archway you find a Brougham, which is
at your service for two francs an hour, and a trifle to the man. The
turn-out is not of course dazzling, and the coachman drives with a rein
in each hand and his whip over his shoulder; but equipages in general
are not very stylish here, and the whole thing is decent, clean, and
comfortable. Your Tourist would not undervalue the London Hansom; it is
an incomparable carriage of its kind, and has become a necessity for
young men of fashion like himself. Bowling down Piccadilly to St.
James's Street at fifteen miles an hour under the whip of one of the
tremendously swell cabmen who ply in those parts, is a perfectly unique
pleasure. But you can't take your wife or your sister with you in such a
rampant vehicle; and if you have no carriage of your own, you will feel
the advantage of having a decent <i>coupé</i> within call at cab fare.</p>

<p>Then, without the trouble of carrying a wonderful lamp about with
you&#8212;which would be excessively inconvenient, not to say
ungentlemanlike, to our notions&#8212;you can instantaneously command the
services of a slave at the moderate price of a franc per errand. In
London, unless a man has an establishment of servants, or is staying at
an hotel, he must go his errands himself, or trust the questionable
fidelity of a crossing sweeper.</p>

<p>Having hired your carriage and servants, you can at once find a
lodging
of any degree of pretension (ornamented with five-and-forty clocks, if
you like, and as many looking glasses), where you take up your abode
without being bored for references. Here you can live as in chambers in
the Temple, only very much more comfortably, with domestics always at
hand yet never intruding, and free from that intolerable surveillance
that a London lodging-house keeper thinks it her duty to keep on her
patrons. As long as you pay your rent you may keep your own hours and
select your own company. (<span class="smcap">Mrs. P&#8212;rk&#8212;ns</span> I fear
 never reads your paper,
Sir, or she could not fail to be of a sweeter temper than she is; but,
on the chance of her seeing this number, allow me to tell her that she
is like a toad, both ugly and also venomous, likewise a dragon, and in
other respects objectionable, while the curtains of her first-floor are
a standing miracle, containing as they do, in successive strata, vermin
that flourished in the beginning of the present century. Moreover, I did
not purchase that case of curious old Champagne brandy with any view to
encourage her in intemperance, which is disgusting in all, and
especially in females.)</p>

<p>As you walk in the streets far from home you can satisfy any want,
however minute or unexpected, down to having your clothes brushed, your
boots cleaned (by the way, Parisian boot-cleaning is an utter and total
failure), or even having your nails cut. This last does not strike an
Englishman as much of a luxury; but we must remember that here a
paternal government has, in its tender care for home cutlery, decreed
that no Frenchman shall be able to purchase a decent knife, razor, or
pair of scissors, under about twice its value.</p>

<p>Your Correspondent, whose meditative mind leads him to trace causes
in
their effects, attributes to this policy the length of beard and
fingernails which distinguishes, if it does not adorn, all ranks here
(he flatters himself that the connexion between cutlery and cleanliness
has not been remarked upon before). You can also have your corns chopped
about, if you have any fancy for permanent lameness, at a very moderate
figure. In short, every operation of the toilet may be gone through by
means of a short series of visits without opening your dressing-case.</p>

<p>You have the gayest promenades in the world, and if it rains,
abundance
of cover with rather more opportunity of amusing yourself than there is
in the Burlington Arcade, for there is always a bustle, and everything
you see is pretty, except the women. A few sous for a cup of coffee or a
glass of liqueur entitle you to spend your whole afternoon in a <i>café</i>,
ventilated and lighted to perfection, where you may read all the
journals, and amuse your leisure with the manly game of dominoes.
Compare this with the dingy, dirty, beer and tobacco-scented
coffee-rooms of London, where they think you a "sweep" (that is the
expression I believe) if you don't make yourself nearly drunk on their
poisonous fluids, and where the inside sheet of the <i>Times</i> is
always
"in hand." It is a constant wonder to me what unfortunate foreigners do
to fill up their afternoons in our smoky Babylon.</p>

<p>You dine as you like, economically or splendidly, without the terrors
 of
indigestion before you; and after a cup of coffee (almost an
unattainable luxury in London), you have your choice of Grand or Comic
Opera, Classical Drama, or Vaudeville, the only objection to which is,
that after once seeing careful and refined acting, you will rather lose
your taste for the "genuine effects" of the British stage, and may
possibly, on your return home, set down the favourite performers as
awkward sticks or impudent buffoons. As you go to bed, without the fever
that arises from a heavy dinner with beer, Port, and Sherry, you may
reflect that you have not been bored for a single instant of the day,
and contrast with your own case the unutterable misery of the stranger
without friends or a club, who is condemned to pass his time in London.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles Martingale, Esq.</span>, having read the
above, says it's all humbug.
He lodges in Piccadilly (very cheap, only £120 a year, including a
servant's room,) goes to the Bag for breakfast, where he meets his
friends; reads the <i>Morning Post</i>, has a game at Pyramid pool, some
Sherry and Seltzer water, and goes back to dress for the Park, where he
sees his friends again. Then there is sure to be a dinner party, and a
ball or two afterwards, which he tops off with Vauxhall, and perhaps a
look in at the Haymarket as he goes home. Or else he does the domestic,
and takes a friend in a Brougham to Richmond or Greenwich for dinner.
What more can a fellow want to amuse himself? Let him go to Races, or
the Horticultural, or the Opera, or the Play, if he likes; and one thing
he wants to say is, that <i>he</i> thinks <span class="smcap">Curliwig</span>
 no end of fun in a farce;
and, as to buffoonery, fellows may just as easily do that on paper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martingale</span>, what do you mean, Sir? Well,
it's very unfair to run down
native talent. And&#8212;one other thing&#8212;he'd a doosid dead sooner have a
tankard of club beer than the miserable thin stuff they call Claret
here. So he wishes this put in, though he doesn't know about literature
and all that, just to show the public that it's not everybody that is so
easily taken in by foreigners as a fellow he won't mention.</p>

<h2>LARVÆ OF THE CITY OF LONDON.</h2>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/155.png" alt="A" class="cap" width="30%" />

<p class="cap_3">AT the City Court of Sewers&#8212;according to the <i>Times</i>&#8212;certain
 gentlemen
carrying on a nasty business in St. Mary Axe,</p>
</div>

<blockquote><p>"Were summoned upon the certificate of the Medical
Officer of
Health, stating that there is upon these premises a large store of
hides and horns of cattle in an offensive state, and the same is
likely to be prejudicial to the health of persons whose habitations
are in the neighbourhood of the same."</p></blockquote>

<p>The cattle were dead&#8212;but the hides and horns were alive. We shall be
excused further details. But</p>

<blockquote><p>"One of the defendants said, he had been on the spot many
 years in
constant attendance on the business, and he had not, during the
whole period, a moment's illness. He believed that, so far from being
prejudicial, the ammonia, which had been represented as so
offensive, had operated as a preventive of the cholera in the
vicinity of the place in which the hides were deposited."</p></blockquote>

<p>According to this gentleman, if putrefaction generates the bane, it
also
develops the antidote; but, unfortunately, when both are taken together
it usually happens that the former is a great deal too strong for the
latter. We must note one more exquisite morsel of physiology.</p>

<blockquote><p>"A <span class="smcap">Commissioner</span> said, he
really believed that it was the wish of
some people to make a private parlour of the City of London.
(<i>Laughter and cries of 'Oh!'</i>). He had lived many years, and his
father before him, in the midst of the matters complained of, and a
healthier family never existed than that which they had successively
brought up in the City. He wished that the gentlemen who were so
nice were obliged to go without meat for 12 months."</p></blockquote>

<p>The family to which this individual belongs must be a curious one. A
naturalist would like to see it. What class of creatures can it be that
lives and thrives "in the midst of the matters complained of?" Have they
got any legs?&#8212;if so, how many, or is the structure of their bodies
annular? Do they change into anything, lie torpid, and then change again
into something else, with wings? In that case do they fly away, and
where do they go to? In any case, where do they expect to go to?</p>

<h2>A LITERARY MILLIONAIRE.</h2>

<p>Nobody expects to hear of a Literary Millionaire in England, unless
it
be the author of a Million of Facts, or a Million Nuts to Crack for
Christmas. In France, however, authors are more fortunate, for <span
class="smcap">Scribe</span>,
the celebrated dramatist, has just purchased an estate, for which he has
given upwards of ten thousand pounds sterling. Fancy an English
dramatist purchasing, or even succeeding to any estate whatever, except,
perhaps, man's estate, though even this he scarcely ever seems to reach,
for he seldom appears to arrive at years of discretion.</p>

<p>We wonder that poor <span class="smcap">Scribe</span> can feel secure
 in the enjoyment of his
purchase, without being under the apprehension that some English
translator or adapter will attempt to translate the property and adapt
it to his own use in some way or other. The French author has been
accustomed to have all his plots mercilessly seized, and why should not
his ground plots be subjected to the same piratical process? <span
class="smcap">Scribe</span> is
the author of his own fortune, and we shall not be astonished to find
some of our British dramatists&#8212;from mere habit&#8212;attempting to
appropriate the proceeds of his authorship, by claiming a portion of the
fortune he has realised. If some of our playwrights should ever purchase
estates, we may be sure they would be "copy"-hold, inasmuch as nothing
original&#8212;not even an original lease&#8212;could be expected at their hands.</p>

<h2>TO FIGHT OR NOT TO FIGHT? THAT IS THE QUESTION.</h2>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/158.png" alt="O" class="cap" width="30%" />

<p class="cap_3">OUR curiosity has been not merely on tip-toe, but
positively upon stilts
for some months past, watching the no result of the hostile
correspondence between the Great Bear and the little Turkey-cock. The
whole affair has been almost as absurd as an "affair of honour;" and if
the parties concerned had been individuals instead of nations, the
business would have long ago been brought to a conclusion, by being
overwhelmed with a storm of ridicule. If any other notes than diplomatic
notes had passed on this occasion, there would have been no end to the
quizzing that the proceeding would have elicited. If Russia had been
<span class="smcap">Brown</span> and Turkey had been <span class="smcap">Jones</span>,
 if France had been <span class="smcap">Smith</span> and England
had been <span class="smcap">Robinson</span>, if Austria had been <span
class="smcap">Snooks</span> and Prussia had been
<span class="smcap">Tomkins</span>, how ludicrous would have been the
"note" as drawn up by <span class="smcap">Snooks</span>,
with the concurrence of <span class="smcap">Smith</span> and <span
class="smcap">Robinson</span>, but amended by <span class="smcap">Jones</span>,
 and
dissented from by <span class="smcap">Brown</span>, on a point of
personal dignity! If <span class="smcap">Robinson</span> and
<span class="smcap">Smith</span> were required to give their good
offices, by deciding whether the
note should be read in a Brownian or in a Jonesian sense, and if <span
class="smcap">Snooks</span>
were suspected of secretly siding with <span class="smcap">Brown</span>,
 while <span class="smcap">Tomkins</span> was supposed
to be shuffling out of an alliance with <span class="smcap">Smith</span>
 and <span class="smcap">Robinson</span> from a secret
fear of <span class="smcap">Jones</span>, the whole world would go off, <i>avec
 explosion</i>, into a
fit of merriment at the trumpery pretensions of the parties involved,
and the utter insignificance of their quarrel.</p>
</div>

<p>Such, however, is the true complexion to which the thing must come,
if
divested of the exaggerated dimensions which are given to it by the
interests that are unfortunately jeopardised. The quarrel would be but a
very common-place quarrel, after all, if it were not for the unfortunate
fact that <span class="smcap">John Bull's</span> nose has somehow or
other got poked into the
affair, and that he will probably have to pay through the nose for the
awkward position he occupies.</p>

<p>Did you ever find a "professional" win a game of billiards of you
without assigning your defeat entirely to his "flukes?"</p>

<p>Did you ever know a cockney take to boating without dressing himself

<p>Did you ever meet a diner-out of sufficient strength of mind to ask
for
"cabbage?"</p>

<p>Did you ever hear a loo-player confess to having won more than "just a
shilling or two?"</p>

<p>Did you ever know a pic-nic go off without the awful apparition of a
"wops?"</p>

<p>Did you ever know a penny-a-liner who, in speaking of a fire, could
abstain from calling it "the devouring element?"</p>

<p>Did you ever find a Continental shopkeeper whose "<i>prix fixe</i>"

be proved a <i>lucus-a</i>-nonentity?</p>

<p>Did you ever start upon a railway journey without hearing the
immortal
observation "<i>Now</i> we're off?"</p>

<p>Did you ever know an "alarming sacrifice," which in practice did not
prove to be completely one of principle?</p>

<p>Did you ever in your life hail a City-bound omnibus that wasn't going
"a'most directly" back to Bayswater?</p>

<p>And as a final clincher&#8212;Did you ever know a cabman who, since the new
Act came in force, could by any eloquence be induced to give you change
for a shilling?</p>

 about the price of victuals

pies, nor venison, nor prawns, nor grilled turkey, nor apricot tarts,
nor anything of that sort, which it quite makes one's mouth water to
read of in the <i>Times</i>&#8212;nor I don't drink no foreign wines, though I
once tasted some which was pretty much like ink and water. No, Sir, I
likes my good old English beef, or bread and cheese, and my pot of beer
along with it, and I think they taste the sweeter when they are not
'leavened with a sense of injustice,' as the late <span class="smcap">Sir

these
last three years. It is the same with <i>Mourir pour la Patrie</i>&#8212;no
one
cares for that now; and as for <i>Vive Henri Quatre</i>, not one copy
has
left my shop, I should say, since the day when the <span class="smcap">Duchesse
 de Berri</span> was
caught in a cupboard. The only song that is asked for at present is
<i>Partant pour la Syrie</i>, and we don't sell many of those. Ah! Sir,
it is
a bad sign when the people don't sing! Many a revolution in France has
been caused by a song, and more than one throne has been upset from the
want of one!"</p>

<h2>LARES AND PENATES FOR THE POTHOUSE.</h2>

<p>High Art in British Sculpture is out of the question&#8212;except as, in
the
case of the <span class="smcap">Duke of York's</span> image and that of <span
 class="smcap">Nelson</span>, when the figure is
placed on the top of a tall column. This is in most instances by far the
best place for it; the generality of our statues being objects of such a
nature as to render it advisable that their view should borrow the very
largest amount of enchantment that can be lent thereto by distance.</p>

<p>The Sublime in plastic Art is hopelessly unattainable by <span
class="smcap">John Bull</span>: he
has never yet been able to manage to pass the boundary which separates
it from the Ridiculous. We had better stick to the latter, wherein we
excel. To be sure, it may be doubted whether any production of the
native chisel, meant for fun, could be more funny than the forms of
pigtail, of wig, of military uniform and official costume, which that
instrument is seriously employed to dignify. But why continue to adorn
our churches and public buildings with monuments of gallant officers
accoutred for parade, of bishops in confirmation costume, and of
half-nude unshapely statesmen with cropped whiskers, in the dishabille
of a loose sheet, apparently draped, in an uncomfortable manner, to
undergo the operation of shaving? These things do not excite the
feelings which they are meant to address&#8212;some of them, on the contrary,
instead of warming the imagination, suggest a very unpleasant idea of
catching cold.</p>

<p>But then, when British Sculpture attempts a tobacconist's Highlander,
 or
a Gog or Magog, it succeeds admirably, and there is a special direction
in which it once promised to do wonders; that of bass-relief on the
exterior of brown jugs. Here was native talent forming a channel for
itself, in which perhaps it had better run freely, exercising
originality, than labour with imitative and simious toil at the
manufacture of ideal Art-Alepots.</p>

<p>On Art-Alepots, however, of a humorous and comical design, and
kindred
subjects, the British sculptor might work with immense success. We have
abandoned the Greek and Roman mythology (modern as well as ancient) for
the most part, but we have still a sort of Temple of <span class="smcap">Bacchus</span>;
 the Gin
Shops and the Public-houses. To the decoration of these the British
sculptor could direct his abilities right profitably.</p>

<p>At a recent meeting of the Middlesex Magistrates&#8212;according to the
<i>Times</i>&#8212;the chairman of the Bench, <span class="smcap">Mr. Pownall</span>,
 delivered an oration to
the applicants for publicans' licenses for music and dancing Wherein&#8212;</p>

<blockquote><p>"After expressing his own desire, and that of his
colleagues, to do
all in their power to promote a national taste for music by granting
music licenses, he cautioned such applicants as should be fortunate
enough to obtain them, not to attempt to open penny or twopenny
concert rooms, lest by so doing they should attract the customers
of, and injure the draught of liquor in the neighbouring
public-houses. He warned them that if they were so ill-advised as to
build and fit up spacious and well-ventilated music saloons for the
accommodation of the public, and to repay themselves by taking money
at the doors, instead of by an increased sale of beer and gin, and
so 'create a monopoly in their own favour,' they must recollect that
they did so 'entirely at their own risk,' that is, at the risk of
having their concert rooms closed by the licensing Magistrates on
the next licensing day."</p></blockquote>

<p>Now, in the Middlesex Magistrates, as represented by <span
class="smcap">Mr. Pownall</span>, and
not in them only, but in the whole unpaid Bench, might the British
sculptor find models for household gods to embellish pot-houses withal.
Their worshipful forms might be carved to stand as chimney ornaments, or
to stride in the character of the jolly divinity upon barrels over
tap-room doors. The "fair round belly with good capon lined," of the
worthy justice would exceedingly well become that situation; for the
national organ of music which the magistracy wish to cultivate appears
to be a barrel-organ. No stout, no song; no beer, no ballad; no porter,
no piano; no heavy, no harp; no fuddle, no fiddle; are the maxims which
regulate their philharmonic ordinances. No gin, no glee, is their
decree; no go, and no chorus. Therefore the mantelpiece of every
Jerry-shop ought to be embellished with their statuettes, and so ought
that of every big brewer and gin-spinner, their private connexions,
consulting whose vested interests under the pretence of a regard to
public duty, they violate the very essential principle of Free Trade, in
order to prevent the competitors of their friends from "creating a
monopoly in their own favour."</p>

<h2>LIBEL ON THE PRINCE OF WALES.</h2>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/159b.png" alt="A" class="cap" width="30%" />

<p class="cap_3">A Sunday paper, which affects to consider itself the
organ of the Court,
has fallen into a libel through its excessive propensity to flunkeyism.
The following is the libellous paragraph:&#8212;</p>
</div>

<blockquote><p>"<span class="smcap">The Prince of Wales and the Shopman.</span>&#8212;During
 one of the late Royal
visits to the Dublin Exhibition the Royal children wandered about in
the toy section of the building, while the <span class="smcap">Queen</span>
 and <span class="smcap">Prince Albert</span>
were in other departments. The <span class="smcap">Prince of Wales</span>
 showed a precocious
tact in striking a bargain. He asked the price of an elaborate
specimen of carving in bog-oak. The shopman in attendance, quite
overwhelmed with the unexpected honour, answered distractedly, "a
shilling"&#8212;the true price being about fifteen shillings. The Prince,
with a promptitude worthy the future ruler of a great commercial
nation, closed with the bargain at once, laid down his shilling, and
walked off with his prize. This little incident will probably make
the fortune of the exhibitor, who is constantly surrounded by groups
of the curious, and preserves the shilling under a glass vase, only
to be shown to the most favoured of the customers."</p></blockquote>

<p>While transferring the above paragraph to our columns, we beg to
protest
against its truth, and to express our contempt for the awkward
flunkeyism which endeavours to compliment the heir to the throne by
imputing to him an act of what an American would call "smartness," and
an Englishman would designate dishonesty. The imputation thrown upon the
little <span class="smcap">Prince</span> is that he took advantage of a
shopman's mistake to obtain
for a shilling what was worth fifteen, and this is clumsily described as
a feat "worthy the future ruler of a great commercial nation." What
great commercial principle is comprised in the act which has thus
falsely, as we believe, been attributed to the Prince we are at a loss
to perceive; but, if our contemporary carries on its commercial concerns
in the spirit it seems so much to admire, we should decline having any
dealings with it "in any shape or way" whatever.</p>

<p>We should like to know what the proprietors of the paper would say if
 a
"smart" news-boy were to enter the office, asking the price of a quire
of the journal, and on being told sixpence by mistake, he were to throw
down that sum, and seizing up some ten shillings-worth of property, were
to hurry away with it. Such an "incident" would more probably become the
subject of a police charge than of a puffing paragraph.</p>

<h2>PHOTOGRAPHIC "GLIMPSES OF THE MOON."</h2>

<p class="cap_3"><span class="smcap">Professor Phillips</span>, than
whom <span class="smcap">Endymion</span> was not a more fervent admirer
of
the moon, has succeeded in inducing her, not merely to sit for her
portrait, but even to paint it. When</p>
</div>

<div class="poem1"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i6">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His great
 bright eye most silently</p>
<p class="i6">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to the

<p>we may be sure that</p>

<div class="poem1"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i8">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Right graciously</p>

</div></div>

<p>since she allows him to carry away so many softened images of her
charms. For other men she exists only in apogee or in perigee, but he
possesses her also in effigy, and can contemplate her at his leisure,
when her face is "gone from the gaze" of ordinary mortals. Nevertheless
he intends, with a liberality that does him honour, to make his fellow
men partners of his good fortune, and has therefore entrusted her
relative, and namesake, the late eminent printseller of Threadneedle
Street, with the preparation of engravings from the aforesaid
photographs. <i>Punch</i> is happy to present the world with a
prospectus of
these engravings, which are three in number. The first depicts her as
she appeared on her "conjunction with <span class="smcap">Jupiter</span>."
 She is attired in her
bridal dress, a robe of white aërophane, spangled with stars; <span
class="smcap">Jupiter</span> is
just stepping forward to "endow her with his ring;" and <span
class="smcap">Charles's Wain</span>
waits in the background to convey the happy couple to their destination.
The second picture is evidently meant to be a companion to the first,
for in it she is represented on the <i>wane</i>, whilst the celestial <span
 class="smcap">Bootes</span>,
who has been holding the horses' heads, is once more putting the ribbons
into the hand of <span class="smcap">Charles</span>.</p>

<p>In the last plate of the series, the "expression of her features,"
(as
was said of the young lady who wore a wreath of roses) is "more
thoughtful than before," and we scarcely need to be told by the
accompanying letterpress, that she has just been reading in the
afternoon's <i>Sun</i> an account of the difficulties by which her
beloved
brother, the <span class="smcap">Emperor of China</span>, is surrounded.</p>

<p>Great hopes were at first entertained that she would allow a fourth
plate to be executed, displaying her as she appeared when "the cow
jumped over the moon;" but she steadfastly refuses her assent to this
proposition, alleging, with much reason, that, whilst only the learned
few could trace in the legend of this saltatory performance an allusion
to the mystical fellowship of the Egyptian <span class="smcap">Apis</span>
 with <span class="smcap">Isis</span>, the lunar
deity, the many would treat it as irreverently as did the little dog who
is said to have "laughed at such sport;" and that, although the dish may
on that occasion have run away with the spoon, the plate thus executed
would find no spoon spooney enough to elope with it.</p>

<hr />

<h2>PARSONS AND DOCTORS.</h2>

<p>Many surgeons, doubtless, remarked an absurd letter from a clergyman
which appeared the other day in the <i>Times</i>, recommending charcoal
in
combination with brandy and opium&#8212;as a cure for cholera. One of them,
dating his letter from Bloomsbury Square, has fortunately written an
answer to that communication, pointing out that the quantity of the
last-named drug prescribed by the parson would amount to 10 or 12 grains
every half-hour; and of course destroy the patient. This clergyman, no
doubt, is a well-meaning person, but he should confine himself to
pointing the way to Heaven, recollecting that the opposite place is
paved with good intentions. Possibly he overstated the quantity of
opium, by what may be called a clerical error; a proper dose of it is
well known to be beneficial in the complaint in question: brandy is also
found useful: and to these two ingredients of the mixture we should be
disposed to ascribe any favourable result of its administration. The
third is probably inert; otherwise it would be a convenient medicine, as
anybody, in case of need, might munch cinders.</p>

<p>Clergymen, in their anxiety to do good, are too often accustomed to
add
the treatment of bodies to the cure of souls. In order to minister to
patients as well as penitents, they ought to possess the gift of
healing, and that having ceased to be supernaturally imparted, they had
better acquire it in the ordinary manner, by attending the hospitals.
Some add hom&oelig;opathy to what the rubric prescribes in the Visitation
of the Sick, and by so doing do the least harm that it is possible to do
by empiricism; as the swallowers of their globules at least die of their
diseases: but we would advise even the hom&oelig;opathic divines to stick
to theological mysticism, and not deal in "riddles" which will generally
be "affairs of death."</p>

<h4>A RAILWAY DOG.</h4>

<p>The papers contained the other day an account of an eccentric dog,
who,
it seems, is in the habit of frequenting the railways, and travelling
about the country from station to station in company with different
engine-drivers. Surely this must be a very unhappy dog, who is afflicted
with a suicidal turn, and whose instinct directs him to the railways as
the surest mode of terminating his existence.</p>

<p>We should like some philosopher to take the matter in hand, and
ascertain whether the dog is a sad dog, a reckless dog, or a mad dog,
that is thus risking the shortening of his dog-days by pursuing such a
line of life, or rather such a line of death, as a line of railway.</p>

<h4>Eagles at a Discount.</h4>

<p>France has lately superseded the jolly old Gallic Cock, and mounted
the
Eagle on the dunghill of national vanity. Eagles have, however, fallen
terribly low in France, and they are being publicly exhibited in every
variety of form and substance, from the Spread Eagle cut in paper, at
three sous, to the Eagle ready to seize on its prey, carved in gilt
wood, at one or two Napoleons. It is quite true that the French have
found their master not at all earlier than they wanted him; and we can't
help recognising the wisdom of substituting the Eagle for the <i>Egalité</i>
humbug that was, for a time, permitted to predominate.</p>

fired off his speech, nothing
was heard but&#8212;<i>Charlie is my Darling.</i></p>

<h2>"THE COMING STRUGGLE."</h2>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/161a.png" alt="A" class="cap" width="30%" />

<p class="cap_3">THE speculations about the "Coming Man" have amused us
for some years;
but expectation having been tired out by waiting for the "man," who,
though always "Coming, coming, coming!" never came, a new dodge has been
started, and we are now called upon&#8212;in a pamphlet, price 6<i>d.</i>&#8212;to
prepare for the "<i>Coming Struggle</i>." According to the author of
this
rather lucrative speculation the world is very shortly to be at an end,
and indeed, it seems that we may as well make arrangements for
terminating all business transactions in 1866, for after that the
Millennium is to commence, when pecuniary affairs are to be a matter of
total indifference. If the author of the "<i>Coming Struggle</i>" is to
be
believed&#8212;and between 100,000 and 200,000 copies of his "speculation"
appear to have been sold, which looks as if some people put faith in his
announcements&#8212;we may expect most of the public companies to begin
winding themselves up, and the Insurance offices especially should
already begin to refuse insurances on healthy lives, for after 1866 no
policy will be payable.</p>
</div>

<p>Such is the credulity of the age, that the author of the "<i>Coming
Struggle</i>" will, probably, realise by this sixpenny "spec.," a very
nice
little competency. We would advise him, however, not to carry the
experiment too far, or he will invest in paper and print all that he has
made: and he has already shown symptoms of a tendency to over-do the
thing by bringing out a "<i>Supplement to the Coming Struggle</i>,"
price
also 6<i>d</i>. Sequels are never successful, and having finished off
the
world comfortably in his first book, we think him injudicious to try the
experiment of another. Poor <span class="smcap">Murphy</span> made a hit
 with one "<i>Weather
Almanack</i>", and, if he had left the thing alone, he might have
preserved
his reputation as a prophet, but when, unfortunately, he risked another
shot and predicted a "coldest day," on which the thermometer was at 60
in the shade, there was an end to his "<i>Weather Almanack</i>" as a
source
of income. We advise the "<i>Coming Struggle</i>" gentleman to be warned
 in
time and not to speculate in "supplements," or "sequels," but to go
altogether on a new tack if he wishes to "put money in his purse," which
is probably the chief aim of his "philosophy."</p>

<h2>A ROYAL "LUNCH" PREVENTED.</h2>

<p>It must be a relief, indeed, to <span class="smcap">Her Majesty</span>
 to get away to Scotland,
where in the retirement of Balmoral she is at least free from the
importunities of that sort of loyalty which deprives her of the common
comforts of a private individual. Provincial Mayors are perhaps the
greatest pests that Royalty has to encounter; and the Preston
Corporation seems to have made itself a fearful bore on the return of
the <span class="smcap">Queen</span> from Scotland. No sooner was it
understood that <span class="smcap">Her Majesty</span>
would stop at Preston fifteen minutes to take luncheon, than the Town
Clerk issued a circular to all the members of the Corporation, calling
on them to meet for the purpose of deciding how the fifteen minutes <span
 class="smcap">Her
Majesty</span> had allowed herself for refreshment could be consumed by
some
municipal twaddle, of which Royalty was to be made the recipient.
Instead of the <span class="smcap">Queen</span> being suffered to take
her hurried basin of
mock-turtle at the station, she was to be bothered with calf's head, in
the shape of the Mayor, and a dish of hash was to be set before her in
the form of an adulatory address from the authorities.</p>

<p>It is indeed hard that Royalty cannot get a quarter of an hour free
for
luncheon on a long journey, but is compelled to give up every minute of
spare time to the swallowing of a quantity of unwholesome stuff in the
way of flattery from the authorities. We admire a loyal address when
circumstances render it appropriate and convenient; but to intercept <span
 class="smcap">Her
Majesty</span> at every resting point on her way, and subject her to the
fatigue of listening to and answering a mass of commonplace rubbish from
the mouth of a Mayor, is no less impertinent on the part of the
authorities, than it must be annoying to the Sovereign. We are quite
sure that the <span class="smcap">Queen</span> would prefer a sandwich
to a puff, and a glass of
sherry to all the milk-and-water in the world&#8212;notwithstanding all the
sugar that the authorities might put into it.</p>

<h4>HOW BRITANNIA SALUTES HER BABIES!</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Britannia</span>&#8212;like a most careful
mother&#8212;expends a world of powder on her
babies. A week ago she flourished the powder-puff regardless of expense;
and regardless of noise. Her three youngest royal babies&#8212;the <span
class="smcap">Princess
Louisa</span>, aged five years; the <span class="smcap">Prince Arthur</span>,
 aged three; and the dear
little poppet <span class="smcap">Prince Leopold</span>, aged not
one&#8212;were all of them brought
down from the nursery at Osborne, and&#8212;with their nurses&#8212;embarked on
board the <i>Fairy</i> to cross to Portsmouth, on their way to Windsor
Castle, to be smothered with kisses by one of the best of mammas, and
one of the tenderest of fathers.</p>

<p>Well, the precious babies passing through Spithead "were saluted by
the
<i>Blenheim</i>, by the garrison, and by the <i>Victory</i>, flag-ship;"
 and this
was ordered by <span class="smcap">Grannam Britannia</span>, who, we
think, by such smoke and
pother rather exposes her dotage than shows her affection. Why should
the "adamantine lips" of sixty-eight pounders salute those little
babies? <span class="smcap">Louisa</span>, being five years old, may be a
 little seasoned to the
custom; and <span class="smcap">Arthur</span>&#8212;(as godson to the <span
class="smcap">Duke</span>)&#8212;may have a precocious taste
for gunpowder; but consider the tender months of baby <span
class="smcap">Leopold</span>! A
suckling, and saluted with a smack of thunder.</p>

<p>Poor little heart! No doubt <span class="smcap">Granny Britannia</span>
 means the noise as an
evidence of her love; but, we needs must think it a proof of her
foolishness. Dear little rose-buds! Why not go to be kissed at Windsor
in all their innocent freshness? Why should they be forwarded to their
parents, new too from Scotland, smelling of gunpowder in which is so
much brimstone?</p>

<h2>THE "VOW OF POVERTY."</h2>

<p>Some Benedictine monks, with a strange mixture of the secular and the
spiritual in their affections, presented themselves a few days ago as
claimants to vote for Members of Parliament. Though they profess to
entirely de-vote themselves to the Church, they do not wish to be
de-voted or deprived of votes for the county of Northumberland. But the
best of the joke&#8212;rather a solemn piece of mockery, by the bye&#8212;was the
fact of their appearing in the character of persons having taken "a vow
of poverty," to claim their right to certain property, in respect of
which they contended that they ought to have the electoral franchise.
The contradictory and anomalous position in which they stood led to a
cross-examination of the claimants, in the course of which some peculiar
views as to the effect of a "vow of poverty" were elicited. The result
seems to be, that a Benedictine monk may be a man of property, though he
has taken a vow of poverty, and that, in the words of one of the
professional men engaged on the occasion, "so far as respects property
the law of poverty has no effect whatever."</p>

<p>The Benedictine monk was a good deal pressed, and in spite of the
ingenuity appropriate to his "order" he was driven into a corner, from
which he could not escape except upon the prong of a fork which the
professional gentleman kept continually presented to the Benedictine
monk, for the latter to fall upon. When told that, "in making the vow of
poverty, he says he has no property whatever," the "monk" could only
reply "We must have property or we could not exist;" so that we are
justified in asking what is the meaning of a vow of poverty, if it can
be taken by a man of property who, on the strength of that property,
lays claim to a vote for the county? The witness when pressed admitted,
"We all have property"&#8212;all <i>we</i> who have made a vow of poverty, or
an
abnegation of property&#8212;but the way we manage it is this: "We have what
is called a 'peculium,' which is a separate thing from the vow of
poverty." It is convenient, certainly, to be able to be poor and rich at
the same time, and to combine all the temporal advantages of property
with the spiritual advantages of poverty. The "peculium" is, of course,
elastic, and there is no particular place for drawing the line in the
banker's book. A vow of poverty which admits of a "peculium" in the
shape of a private fortune is like a vow of tea-totalism, which allows
of a "peculium" in the form of a private gin-bottle.</p>

<h4>Britannia's Safety Belt.</h4>

<p>Considering how much England is indebted for its safety to the magic

its old <span class="smcap">Chops</span>!"</p>

<h2>INFECTION GLEBE.</h2>

<p>Everybody knows that an intramural churchyard has a tendency to
enlarge
itself&#8212;not in area, but in perpendicularity. It is in every sense a
rising concern, and it swells like an investment at compound interest.
The attraction of mortality increases in a ratio multiplying with the
increase of the mass&#8212;and what is there to prevent so deadly a nuisance
from being immediately abolished? Hear the <span class="smcap">Bishop of
 London</span> in his
evidence given before the Lords' Committee on the Great Extramural
Cemetery Bill&#8212;opposed by the <span class="smcap">Lord Bishop</span>:&#8212;</p>

<blockquote><p>"I wish, in a very few words, to explain that, when the
bill was
first printed, the clergy were much alarmed. They saw that it would
interfere with the establishment of parochial burial grounds, and
they objected more particularly to the small amount of compensation
fees which the company intended to pay, viz., 1<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> for
the
open ground, and 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> for the brick graves and vaults."</p></blockquote>

<p>In the country it is a common thing to see sheep grazing in
churchyards,
but in London, by the account of the Bishop, the same pastures afford
food to the shepherds. To the eye of chemists&#8212;who are ghost-seers&#8212;for
ghost and gas "are all one reckonings, save the phrase is a little
variations"&#8212;what a picture is presented by a metropolitan incumbent
praying at his reading desk against pestilence with the cause of it
steaming up all around him in the shape of sulphuretted hydrogen, for
the generation of which he is principally responsible! By all means give
the intramural clergy compensation for the loss they may sustain by
extramural cemeteries, though the poor innkeepers did not get any when
their businesses were destroyed by the railroads. Let them be
compensated even at the Bishop's estimate, which he says he "prevailed
upon <span class="smcap">Mr. Corfield</span>" to adopt, viz., 2s. 6d.
for the open ground and 6s.
6d. for the brick graves. Canterbury Registrars and fat pluralists will
cut up one of these days sufficiently well to supply the needful: in the
mean time let the <i>convives</i> of the earthworm feed without the
walls.</p>

<h2>OUR TOURIST IN PARIS.&#8212;No. 9.</h2>

<p>My dear fellow-countrymen who throng the theatres, the <i>cafés</i>,
and the
promenades of this gay city, may form very different opinions of its
inhabitants and institutions; but on one point, I believe, they are all
agreed; that, in common with the rest of the Continent, it is
over-ridden with bureaus and bureaucracy. Every third man is an
<i>employé</i>, a soldier, or a policeman. You cannot have a warm bath,
without taking a ticket from a lady at a desk, nor indulge in a mild
polka, without being watched by a man in a cocked hat. If you change
your hotel, instant information must be sent to the Préfecture; if you
want to send a telegraphic message to England, it must first receive the
sanction of the Minister of Police; if you enter Paris from a country
walk, with a great-coat on your arm, you will be pounced upon and
searched at the Barrière. All this is disgusting to honest <span
class="smcap">John Bull</span>,
and he curses it with great force of language. "Thank goodness!" says
he, "at all events, we are free from this miserable drilling, and
marshalling, and boarding-school discipline." In England we certainly
are.</p>

<p>Occasionally the London newspapers take the opportunity of an
"illustrious foreigner's" visit, to contrast our liberty and their
thraldom. The leading journal will point out with its usual epigrammatic
terseness, varied illustration, good sense and eloquence, the advantage
of letting people alone, and the extent to which our Government does let
us alone. "His Highness, or Majesty, as the case may be, will ride for
hours in our metropolis with out seeing a soldier or (especially if
there's a row) a policeman." Blessed independence! but the contrast is
much more striking, because more disagreeable to a wretched Englishmen,
born to freedom, who finds himself in a mess on the Continent&#8212;a
contingency which happens to one out of every dozen tourists. Those
confounded passports form the monster grievance. Accordingly from July
to November, not a week passes but some victim writes to complain that
he is in confinement at Marseilles or Como, or somewhere or another,
because his passport is lost or not <i>en règle</i>. Old <span
class="smcap">Jollyboy</span>, I
recollect, wrote a tremendous letter to the <i>Times</i> containing a
column
and a half of his adventures. It ought to have produced a
reconsideration of the whole passport system, but it didn't. Those
foreign governments are so dense!</p>

<p>And now little <span class="smcap">Bombazine</span> (who is "reading
for the bar," like every young
fellow about town that is not in the army) comes to your Correspondent,
and complains of a grievance which throws all the foreign misdemeanours
into the shade. He went to the English Embassy to get his passport
signed, and <i>the man there could not speak English</i>! Now, by <span
class="smcap">Jove, Harry</span>
is right, and it is too bad! Here are we every day ridiculing or cursing
the villainous antiquated machinery of passports. We all know, and are
never tired of repeating, that it works for the persecution of helpless
timid travellers and the protection of brazen and ingenious criminals.
(<span class="smcap">Joseph Mazzini</span> entered Italy a few months
ago in the petticoats and
"front" of an old woman, the policemen taking off their hats and paying
compliments, while a poor English consumptive parson in search of health
was marched off between two chasseurs as if he had been a pickpocket.)
We complain reasonably enough that we travel everywhere scattering our
livres sterling, making the fortunes of innkeepers, creating watering
places, supporting entire branches of commerce, fostering capital
cities, everywhere cheated, pitied, and laughed at, and yet foreign
governments have not the sense to encourage such lucrative and harmless
visitors, but do everything they can to prohibit our free locomotion.
They are great asses, are they not? Call them all the names you like,
and now believe, if you can, that an English establishment abroad is
worse than them all. Our ambassador, as I understand from a diplomatic
friend, receives a very tolerable income from his country by way of
wages and compensation for exile, and yet cannot afford to keep a man in
his office capable of communicating with the multitude of Britons who do
not speak French.</p>

<p>We recollect a certain circular issued from the foreign office at
Washington, which invited the United States' consuls and ambassadors to
employ native Americans and none others in their offices. And quite
right. It is bad enough to have to deal with foreigners about our
passports where it is absolutely necessary, but when we go to our own
Embassy we hope to meet with, if not the <i>personnel</i> at least the
language and plain good sense of the Anglo-Saxon. We <i>might</i> expect
 to
meet also there a disposition to smooth instead of aggravating the
nuisances of the passport system, and, behold, we find an official with
all the French bureaucratic humbug, and without a knowledge of our
tongue. How such a monstrous absurdity could have arisen passes one's
understanding. Good heavens! why every hotel, every <i>café</i>, every
shop,
nay every superior police office, contains one or more persons who speak
English, and the English Embassy is the only establishment without one.
Why don't some of those young swells come down from their room and do
the passport business? Do they think it "low?" But hear <span
class="smcap">Henry Bombazine</span>.</p>

<p>"You know <span class="smcap">Mrs. Toodleham</span>, my Aunt, is
given to reading the papers in
connexion with the prophecies, and has just got hold of a very
entertaining book on those subjects called 'The Battle of Armageddon,'
which has determined her to come to England at once with me. It's by one
of those immensely knowing parties, you see, who tell you about the end
of the world, give 'tips' in fact 'on future events,' like the Derby
prophets in <i>Bell's Life</i>. Well, he says, that Russia is going to
invade
Jerusalem, and the English fleet is to sail into the Dead Sea&#8212;no&#8212;the
United States' fleet is to sail into the Caspian&#8212;no&#8212;hang it! I never
can recollect the names of places&#8212;at all events, there's to be an awful
shindy somewhere, and England is the only safe place to go to. So I went
to the Embassy to get the old lady's name put on my passport, and, as I
said, the fellow couldn't speak a work of English. I tried him with
French" (you <i>should</i> hear dear <span class="smcap">Henry's</span>
French), "and could hardly make
him understand then. He wanted first to see her passport, but, bless
you, she hasn't got any. I don't suppose she ever had one, and at all
events, if she had, must have lost it years ago. You know she came over
to see <span class="smcap">Louis Philippe</span> crowned, and liked the
place so much she has
stayed ever since. And when I told him that, and offered references to
bankers, and so forth&#8212;mind you, he's not over civil in his manner, I
suppose because he can't make anything by the job&#8212;he opened his eyes
till the eyebrows went right away into the hair of his head, and flatly

<h2>DRAT THE EASTERN QUESTION!</h2>

<p class="cap_3">There now, <i>Punch</i>! Drat this nasty stupid
good-for-nothing Eastern
Question. I am sick and sorry of hearing it talked of, din, din, din,
bother, bother, bother, every day, and all day long. Drat the Russians
and Turks both, one's barbarians and the other's savages. I wouldn't
give a fig for either of 'em; the Russians are just as bad as the Turks,
and the Turks every bit as bad as the Russians, there isn't a pin to
choose between 'em, six of one and half-a-dozen of the other. The Turks
commit double and treble bigamy, and the Russians drink train oil; the
Russians are beaten with the knout, and the Turks with the bastinado,
and deserve to be, both alike. Oh, I know all about it, although I am
only an old woman! and what's the whole to-do about but a parcel of
nonsense, ambassadors niggling with their diplomatic notes, and
quibbling backwards and forwards because an i wasn't dotted on one side
and a t crossed on the other. Hity tity! I've no patience with 'em. Of
course, if our bounden duty is to interfere, we must; but it's a great
plague, and sickness in the land, and raining cats and dogs, and bread
up and meat up, and how much higher they'll go goodness knows, but it
will be beyond everything if there should be a war. Drat it! we can't
help pestilence and famine, but it's our own doings if we add war. Not
that I'm for <span class="smcap">Mr. Cobden</span> and your 'No
Soldiers' people that want to do
away with the army and navy, and leave their sisters and mothers to
invasion. Drat them, too&#8212;I despise such dirty drabs. But I do think
it's such annoyance to be drawn in and forced to fight when you've no
heart in the quarrel. What a pity it is we can't leave 'em alone and let
'em fight it out. Neither of 'em is our fellow Christians, Turks being
Mahometans, and Russians Greek, which is as bad as Latin; and what I
should like would be to see them left to themselves and eat each other
up, like the Irish cats&#8212;poor things! Drat the ultimatums, drat the
Phosphorus&#8212;which is always causing a combustion&#8212;drat the Dardanelles
which I am sure they must be some forward husseys&#8212;drat the whole
business, it's altogether a bad job from beginning to end, if there is
to be any end, which if the scrimmage goes on I'm afraid will be the end
of everything. Drat it all I say! I wish I had a good large broom, and
power to sweep both your <span class="smcap">Sultan</span> and your <span
 class="smcap">Emperor</span>, and all their forces
into the Red Sea, or Black Sea, or any sea deep enough to drown 'em out
of the way, interfering, by their nasty trumpery tiffs and tantrums,
with progress and civilisation, and arts and sciences, and the Crystal
Palace at Sydenham, and the comfort and happiness of everybody, to say
nothing of a poor old lady like me.</p>

<h2>THE STARVED-OUT COMMISSION OF SEWERS.</h2>

<p>Everybody is attacking the unfortunate Commissioners of Sewers, who
are
said to be standing still with their hands in their pockets, and who
reply that they are obliged to stand still because they have nothing in
their pockets but their hands. It is true their hands seem to get very
deeply into the public pocket occasionally, but however large the sum
that may be extracted, the cry of the Commissioners is "We have no
funds." If a neighbourhood, thirsty for a good, wholesome fall of water,
applies to the Commissioners, their answer is "We can't stand a dram."
Their song is always to one tune, and that is the tune of "<i>I've no
Money</i>."</p>

<div class="poem1"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">I've no money! so you see</p>
<p class="i0">Nothing can be done by me;</p>
<p class="i2">I own it to my sorrow;</p>
<p class="i0">But if I were rich, you'd see</p>
<p class="i0">Wonders would be done by me;</p>
<p class="i2">So call again to-morrow.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The fact is that the Commissioners of Sewers have such grand ideas
that
execution is impossible. The imagination of the Commissioners riots in
such a sea of sullage, that nothing short of an arched avalanche of
refuse water presents itself to the minds of the functionaries who will
not stoop to anything short of an aqueduct, and consequently have souls
above the making of a common useful drain. Everything must be on such a
scale of grandeur, that unless London can be altogether excavated a few
serviceable pipes cannot be laid down. We are quite willing to admit the
difficulties of the position of the Commissioners with all the sewage of
London on their hands, and some people feel naturally tempted to throw
mud upon those who are in a degree responsible for getting rid of it.
The Chairman, however, seems to take the affair with a sort of
philosophic good nature, as if he felt himself somewhat in the position
of a glass bottle or a plaster bust perched on an eminence for everybody
to take a shy at him.</p>

<h2>MARRIAGE IN "MEDIOCRE" LIFE.</h2>

</div>

<p>One of our fashionable contemporaries, of which there are now three
(including the <i>Morning Advertiser</i>, which "goes in" upon the
aristocratic dodge), contained the other day the account of a marriage
of a Reverend Baronet with a young lady, whose name is not given, but
who is said to be "related to the <span class="smcap">Earl of Rosse</span>."
 This scientific
nobleman may have numerous distant relations, who, on the strength of
his title and his telescope, would like to be looked upon as near
relations, and therefore the bride may or may not be a very close
connection of the Earl. At all events, the persons inserting the
advertisement in the fashionable paper, do not seem to have felt
themselves justified in heading the paragraph with the usual words,
"Marriage in High Life." It was most probably a sort of middle-class
matrimonial connection; though in these days it is hard to say where
high life ends and mediocrity begins. The couple seem to have been
"carriage people," at all events; for as the vehicle&#8212;probably a "neat
fly" with post horses&#8212;approached the bridge, the assembled multitude
raised such "vociferations," says the penny-a-liner, "as to make the
welkin ring." We should like to see the bell attached to the Welkin, and
the Welkin itself in which the phenomenon of "ringing" was produced by
the shouts of the multitude.</p>

<p>On reaching the village the vehicle "proceeded through a triumphal
arch,
ornamented with a lamp." We beg leave to say that we have the honour of
passing under a triumphal arch&#8212;that which bears the Wellington
Statue&#8212;twice a day, and we do so without any feeling of undue vanity,
notwithstanding the fact that it is also "ornamented with a lamp,"&#8212;and
indeed two&#8212;for there is one on each side of it. The penny-a-liner adds
that "on reaching their residence the bride and bridegroom briefly, but
feelingly, returned thanks to the inhabitants." What a pity that we have
not had a full report of the speeches. Where was <span class="smcap">Gurney</span>,
 the short-hand
writer; where was <span class="smcap">Sherer</span>, and what had become
 of <span class="smcap">Morton</span>?</p>

<p>The next time that a marriage in "mediocre" life is celebrated we
trust
that a staff of stenographists will be in attendance to take down the
"speeches" of the bride and bridegroom, as they pass from the neat fly,
gig, or clarence to the inn or hotel they may have chosen for their
mellilunar abode.</p>

<h2>A SPORTING REGIMENT.</h2>

<p>Some Yeomanry heroes, whose head-quarters are at the "Spotted Cow,"
in
York, have been called together by a circular, of which the following is
a copy, to have a day's hunting, on Monday the 31st.</p>

<blockquote><p>"<i>Spotted Cow Inn, Walmgate Bar, York, 18th October,
1853.</i></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir,</span>&#8212;Through the kindness of our Captain (<span
 class="smcap">Lord Viscount Downe</span>), <i>a
day's hunt, or coursing</i>, at Sessay (to the members of his Troop
only), is given, which is proposed to take place on Monday, the last
day of this month. It is also proposed <i>to have a little drill&#8212;each
should attend with his sword and belt</i>. Be so kind as <i>say if you
can procure a dog</i>. An early answer is earnestly requested. Further
particulars will be gladly given, on application to me, or <span
class="smcap">Corp.
Smith</span>.</p>

<p class="regards">"I am, Sir, yours, truly,</p>

<p class="author">"<span class="smcap">Geo. Smith.</span>"</p></blockquote>

<p>It is desirable, we admit, that the yeomanry should be indulged in a
day's hunting, which may practise them in the art of pursuing an enemy,
who in war-time would be fair game. We are somewhat puzzled by the
proposition to mix up "a little drill" with the day's sporting, unless
the "dogs of war" are to hunt in couples&#8212;two abreast. We fear there
will be some difficulty in blending the huntsman and the warrior; nor
can we comprehend the idea of a sporting military gent running after a
fox with "his sword and belt," "taking close order" at the heels of
Reynard, or practising the goose-step by way of "a little drill"
previous to the starting of the game. The passage in the circular which
asks every trooper to "be so kind as to say" if he "can procure a dog,"
is suggestive of an awful assemblage of mongrels, and destructive to all
our ideas of "sport."</p>

<p>We can fancy the canine Babel that would be the consequence if the
brutes should happen to "give tongue." If everybody is "so kind as to
procure a dog," there would inevitably be a regiment of dogs as well as
a regiment of soldiers; there can be no objection to a vast assemblage
of dogs at any given point for a given period, but when the dogs have
had their day, we would ask in a spirit of much misgiving, what is to
become of these dogs when the drill is at an end? We can only say that
we should be sorry to eat a sausage within five miles of the place where
that troop had been assembled, until at least a month after they should
be disbanded, and their dogs should have disappeared.</p>

<h2>PIUS PINGUIS.</h2>

<p>That the <span class="smcap">Pope</span> should have been ordered to
play billiards to counteract
obesity, is a circumstance suggestive of certain natural remarks. A
person who fasts as often as the Roman Pontiff must fast, and yet gets
fat, is a wonder; and perhaps the plumpness of <span class="smcap">Pius</span>,
 attained
principally on red herrings, will be cited one of these days as a
miraculous circumstance. <span class="smcap">Falstaff</span> lost his
voice "by holloaing and
singing of anthems;" but in the meanwhile he gained flesh, as his
Holiness appears to have also done in a similar course of exercise. Many
prelates are oily enough; but the unction of the present Bishop of Rome
is peculiar. The Pontifical chair has often been said to be filled, but
now it is full, and no mistake. Perfidy, the Papists say, never
approached the see of <span class="smcap">Peter</span>; however that may
 be, it certainly will be
difficult to circumvent its existing occupant, as his bulk will baffle
any attempt to get round him. Many of the Holy Father's predecessors
have been deep, but he is broad also.</p>

<p>We should have preferred rackets to billiards as a cure for the Papal
corpulence, if we thought the <span class="smcap">Pope</span> could
stand the rackets, as he will
have to do, whether he can or not, as soon as the state of Europe
obliges <span class="smcap">Louis Napoleon</span> to withdraw the French
 troops from Rome; and that
will prove the most effectual proceeding for the reduction of his
greatness.</p>

<h2>ASTONISHING AND GENEROUS EXERTION BY CATHEDRAL CLERGYMEN.</h2>

<p>The newspapers are continually making remarks of a painful nature on
the
conduct of Deans and Chapters. It is pleasing to encounter an
opportunity of commenting in a more affectionate spirit on the behaviour
of one of those reverend fraternities. That pleasure is afforded us by
the <i>Morning Post</i>&#8212;wherein, under the heading of "Divine Service
for
the Militia," we read that</p>

<blockquote><p>"The necessity of providing some means by which the
Militia, in a
body, could attend Divine Service on Sunday, and the difficulty of
this being secured by the ordinary church accommodation available in
Exeter, induced, we understand, the Lord Lieutenant of the county to
make an application last week to the Cathedral authorities,
suggesting that an extra service on Sunday in that spacious building
would meet the wishes of his lordship."</p></blockquote>

<p>Now, when we consider the average scale on which Deans and Chapters
are
remunerated in relation to their average services, and when, our
reflections guided by the Rule of Three, we inquire how much, at that
rate, an extra service of such a description is worth, we find the sum
considerable. A prebend's sermon is perhaps, as to its abstract merit,
inestimable: a pearl beyond any price: but even its actual cost may be
computed at a high figure. Such a discourse, gratuitously addressed to a
regiment of soldiers, may be regarded as a donation to them of something
handsome per head.</p>

<p>To ask a Cathedral establishment, then, for an extra service, is
asking
it for not a little: to perform such a service is to do a munificent
action. Therefore it is highly gratifying to peruse the statement
following:&#8212;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Notwithstanding, however, the difficulties which
intervened, we
believe it was the earnest desire of the authorities at the
Cathedral to meet as far as possible the urgency of the case, a
desire which was manifested by the promptitude with which they acted
on the suggestions made by the Lord Lieutenant. An extra service was
fixed, exclusively for the Militia, at half-past eight on Sunday
morning, when the whole body of officers and men assembled within
the sacred building, the choir being densely filled from the organ
screen to the altar rails, and such as could not obtain admission
being within hearing in the side aisles. Prayers were read by the
<span class="smcap">Reverend Chancellor Harington</span>, who also
preached an impressive and
appropriate sermon."</p></blockquote>

<p>Besides, it is announced that on Sunday next, and for the two Sundays
following, indeed until the Militia are dismissed, the same service will
be performed at the same hour. It should be added, that the only Canons
in residence were the <span class="smcap">Rev. Chancellor Harington</span>
 and the <span class="smcap">Ven. Archdeacon
Moore Stevens</span>, and that the Chancellor being also Chaplain to the
troops, "had, in addition to his duties at the Cathedral, to provide
extra services for both barracks." The reverend gentleman who has been
performing so many extra services, might almost be supposed to be called
Canon of Exeter by a mistake in pronunciation; his proper title being
Canon of Extra. At all events he ought not to be styled a Canon in
Ordinary, for he is an Extraordinary Canon; and in making this
observation, if anybody thinks that we intend a mere play upon words, he
is mistaken; for what we chiefly wish is to call attention to a fact.
That a prebend should occasionally preach and read prayers of a Sunday a
few more times than he is obliged to do, may hereafter come to be
regarded as not so very extraordinary a sacrifice of that <i>otium</i>
which
is enjoyed <i>cum dignitate</i> by the dignified Clergy. The
circumstance, at
least, will perhaps not be thought so extraordinary as to constitute a
special case for penny-a-lining.</p>

<hr />

<h2>NASAL INTELLIGENCE.</h2>

<p>One of "our own Correspondents," speaking of the <span class="smcap">Emperor's</span>
 late
reception at Lille, remarks, as it appears to us, a rather curious
phenomenon. "At about nine o'clock," he says,</p>

<blockquote><p>"The <span class="smcap">Emperor</span> and <span
class="smcap">Empress</span> drove to the theatre, where there was a
most loyal reception; and, but that the wet clothes and the soaking
umbrellas gave out the odours peculiar to wet coats, the scene would
have been splendid."</p></blockquote>

<p>How the odours of wet clothes could possibly have prevented the
splendour of the scene, we confess we are rather at a loss to imagine.
For ourselves, we certainly should as soon dream of hearing a sight as
of smelling one. That there exists a certain connection between the
visual and olfactory organs we don't pretend to dispute. In the absence
of profounder proof we do remember an "eye-snuff," which they who were
up to it of course took nasally. At the same time we cannot well see how
the sense of seeing can be interfered with by the nose, unless indeed it
be a preternaturally long one.</p>

<h2>JAMES'S POWDER, AND HIS SQUIB.</h2>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/169.png" alt="S" class="cap" width="30%" />
<p class="cap_2">SOME of the Virginian slaveholders, true to the kind of
 logic which one
expects from <span class="smcap">Legrees</span>, have made five attempts
 to burn down the house of
the English consul, <span class="smcap">Mr. G. P. R. James</span>, as a
reply to some objections
urged by that gentleman to negro slavery. It appears that years ago,
before <span class="smcap">Mr. James</span> attained that world-wide
celebrity which has
irrevocably placed him at the summit of English literature (we are sure
he will be the last person to contradict us), he concocted a "squib"
against the slave-owning system. The missile flew so silently and
harmlessly through English air that nobody seems to have listened to it,
but the case appears to have alighted on American ground, and to have
been treasured up by the fortunate finder as evidence against the
pyrotechnician and historiographer. <span class="smcap">Mr. James</span>
 receives his appointment
and goes to Virginia, the squib is produced, and excites the fierce rage
of the man-stealers, who, as has been said, make five attempts to burn
down the great novelist's house. Whether, being as cowardly as <span
class="smcap">Mrs.
Stowe</span> has taught us to regard them, the conspirators made their
efforts
in the night, and being scared by the noise made by the distinguished
author in snuffing his candle, the click being mistaken for the cocking
of a rifle, or whether, in the frantic tipsiness which, the authoress of
<i>Uncle Tom</i> tells us, accompanies their social orgies, they
endeavoured
to set fire to a stone wall, or to the <i>Life and Times of</i> <span
class="smcap">Louis XIV</span>.,
or any other impracticable mass, we are not informed&#8212;perhaps cowardice
and clumsiness were united, as in every other effort in defence of
slavery. Anyhow, <span class="smcap">Mr. James's</span> property had, at
 the last advices, escaped
the vengeance of those who, brutalised by slave-owning, can hardly think
much of arson. Meantime, we have been anxious to see this celebrated
squib, and having applied in vain to <span class="smcap">Mr. James's</span>
 London publishers, we
have been compelled to send over to America for it. The document arrived
by the United States' Mail steamship Washington, which reached Cowes on
Friday night, bringing mails to the 8th, and it was instantly forwarded
to us by a special train on the South Western line. We hasten to give
it.</p>

<h4>YACHT SIGNALS.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Punch</span> has merely to acknowledge a very
 useful little book, prettily

"<i>Supplementary Code of Yacht Signals</i>." It is not of much use to
him in
Fleet Street, but he intends to keep it until the yachting season begins
again, when he will astonish Cowes, Ryde, and "the Island" generally,
with the proficiency he displays in nautical, as in all other exercises.
That the Yacht Club may appreciate the value of the book, <i>Mr. Punch</i>
subjoins a page taken at random. Loungers on shore little know what is
meant by the innocent-looking flags which are perpetually being run up
from the <i>Salmagundi</i>, the <i>Olla Podrida</i>, the <i>Amontadillo</i>,
 and the
other pretty vessels about which they talk so learnedly. Perhaps this
extract may enlighten them:&#8212;</p>

<h4>SHE WILL BE A MARTYR.</h4>

<p>A letter from France says that <span class="smcap">Miss Cunninghame</span>
 on receiving the order
for her release from prison, positively refused to go, until she was
literally turned out. The invitations of the officials to her to "come
out of that," were altogether idle; and indeed it is quite evident that
the lady felt how completely her pretensions to martyrdom had been cut
short by her premature release. <span class="smcap">Miss Cunninghame</span>
 in fact proved herself
a perfect "Buffalo gal" in her indisposition to "come out," until a due
amount of solicitation had been addressed to her.</p>

<p>For our own parts, had we been the British officials employed to
negotiate for her release, and she had shown a stubborn disposition to
cling to her prison bars, we should have allowed her to remain, and ride
as rusty as the bars themselves. We never could see what right she had
to scatter Italian <span class="smcap">Bunyans</span> all over the boot
of Italy, and put her own
foot in it. We admit the severity of the punishment and the propriety of
getting her out of her prison, though as a general rule it must be laid
down, that those who enter a foreign country for the purpose of
disturbing its harmony, must expect now and then to have to take a few
bars rest.</p>

this is unnecessary; remembering the effect of Spanish bonds, Spain has
been especially eminent for her enormous screw power.</p>

<h2>RURAL SELF-DENIAL CLUBS.</h2>

<p>The laudable custom adopted by agricultural societies of rewarding
labourers for living and rearing families upon ten shillings a week,
might be carried further out. Mutual improvement associations should be
established among the rustics, for the purpose of cultivating abstinence
by means of emulation. Country gentlemen would formerly encourage
eating-matches among the peasantry: the reverse of this gross practice
should be adopted now: and clodhopper should be pitted against
clodhopper to do the greatest amount of work on the smallest quantity of
bread and water in a given time. The clowns should also be stimulated to
compete on holidays, particularly at those of Christmas, when the
weather especially affords the requisite conditions, by trying which can
continue longest sitting in the cold without any fire, and which can
dispense to the greatest extent with clothes and bedding. By these
wholesome exercises they will be trained to contentment with the very
smallest possible participation in the fruits of that earth which they
cultivate, so as to leave the larger share to the gentry who subsist by
their industry, to be expended in all manner of comfort, pleasure,
splendour, and magnificence. Thus, as happiness is attainable in either
of two ways&#8212;one consisting in the satisfaction, the other in the
conquest of our desires&#8212;they would make themselves happy by the former
method, and their labourers by the latter.</p>

<h2>SINGING-BOYS MINUS SEVENPENCE AT ST. PAUL'S.</h2>

<p>Parson Rook! Why Rook? What has Parson to do with Rook? a child might
ask, puzzled by that nursery collocation of bird and clerical gentleman.
Both black? Then why not Chimney Sweep Rook?&#8212;Undertaker Rook? The
explanation is too superficial to satisfy even the infant mind.</p>

<p>Now, when we consider that the Dean and Canons of St. Paul's have, as
 we
are credibly informed, stopped the sevenpence a week&#8212;the penny a
day&#8212;heretofore from time immemorial allowed the little chorister
children for pocket-money, we are induced to pursue some interesting
inquiries:&#8212;</p>

<p>Who took away the poor boys' stipends? Who has taken their lollipops
out
of their mouths? Who robbed them of their penny tarts? Who keeps
cathedral stalls and ruins apple-stalls?&#8212;may be enumerated as some of
those questions which we are disposed to propound.</p>

<p>But we also revert to the child's interrogation&#8212;why Parson Rook?&#8212;and
we find we can answer it in a highly satisfactory manner.</p>

<p>Be it premised, that the reason assigned for this mulct of the
acolytes
is that by the proceeds thereof the washing of their surplices may be
paid for. They are to wear fine linen, but not to fare sumptuously every
day: that mode of life is reserved for the port-vinous appropriators of
their cake money. Vainly has the tax been taken off soap, seeing that
the Dean and Chapter of St. Paul's are so ill off for it. But the
article is an important one to close shavers. Therefore the choristers
are docked of their allowance, and the loud-voiced anthem will blend
with the secular strain, "<i>I've no Money</i>."</p>

<p>We now come to inquire what has happened to render the ecclesiastical
corporation of St. Paul's unable any longer to stand soap. What has
necessitated the demand for the sevenpences of the children to defray
their surplice-washing?&#8212;whereof the ordinary cost would be fourpence by
the tariff of our laundress.</p>

<p>This has happened: the relinquishment, on the part of that reverend
society, of the twopences formerly taken at the doors of their church;
which having been extorted from them by popular indignation, they now,
we suppose, indemnify themselves by a sevenpenny confiscation at the
expense of the little vocalists.</p>

<p>And thus we arrive at a perception of the connection between Parson
and
Rook; for these men are Parsons: and we discover that they possess an
anatomical organ in common with that bird, and with other birds that
consume the fruits of the earth. The existence of that organ is revealed
by its symptoms of suffering. The Dean and Chapter of St. Paul's, in
withdrawing the sevenpences, show that the loss of the twopences <span
class="smcap">sticks
in their Gizzards</span>.</p>

<h4>The Pope's Game.</h4>

<p>England little suspected the game that the <span class="smcap">Pope</span>
 has been playing. It
turns out to be billiards.</p>

<p>His Holiness no doubt has his cue given him by one of the astutest
Members of the College of Cardinals.</p>

<p>His aim, no doubt, is the old traditional one&#8212;to put the globe into
his
pocket.</p>

<hr />

<h4>Good Old English Pastime.</h4>

<p>The Elizabethan age delighted in bear-baiting; and it seems not
improbable that the reign of <span class="smcap">Victoria</span> will
witness a similar amusement.
A formidable Russian bear has broken loose in the Danubian
Principalities, and a large number of British bulldogs have been already
collected to worry him, unless he speedily retreats into his den.</p>

<hr />

<h4>A MISTAKEN MEASURE.</h4>

<p>A Strike is generally supposed to be another name for a Bushel. It
is,
however, a Sack, which certain workmen are so infatuated as to give
themselves.</p>

<h2>LITERATURE AT LOW WATER MARK.</h2>

<p>A book with the odd title of "<i>A History of the Fountains of Europe</i>"
has recently appeared. The subject cannot possibly be a dry one, but
(without wishing to throw cold water on the author) we are bound to say
that we have no particular thirst for the knowledge he undertakes to
impart. We fear that amid the fountains of Europe our own Metropolitan
fountains must cut as sorry a figure in history as they do in Trafalgar
Square. We feel some curiosity to know what an author can possibly say
about the Charing Cross fountain, and whether he is satisfied with
merely a glance at it&#8212;which is the case with every one who sees it&#8212;or
whether he traces its biography from the cistern to the slop-basin, the
cradle to the grave. The historian of the Fountains of Europe prefaces
his work with an essay on raising the water, but we are inclined to
think he would have a far more numerous body of readers if he could
offer a few hints on the possibility of raising the wind.</p>

<h2>SHAVING BY MACHINERY.</h2>

<p>We have tried every kind of shave at every variety of price, from the
shilling operation of the West End to that most frightful of tortures,
"an easy shave for a halfpenny," in the New Cut, Lambeth. We have been
shaved by a drunkard, under whose "effacing fingers" we have felt our
beard bristling up with fear, "like quills upon the fretful porcupine,"
and we have been shaved by an aged individual with the palsy, who has
made sudden darts at us with the razor, and ultimately triumphed over
the difficulties that stared him in the face&#8212;that is to say, in our own
face&#8212;with a "bloodless victory." We have been shaved by a woman in
Scotland; by an apprentice in Shoreditch; by a sailor on board ship in a
storm; by ourselves in the dark; by a schoolfellow, for fun; and by
young beginners, for practice. In fact, we have shown a sort of reckless
audacity in getting rid of our beard, that would have justified our
enemies in saying that we have evinced a wondrous amount of bold-faced
effrontery. But, notwithstanding all these perils which flesh is heir
to, in having the hair removed from the flesh, we should be afraid to
patronise, or give our countenance to, a certain new invention which is
described in the following newspaper paragraph:&#8212;</p>

<blockquote><p>"<span class="smcap">Shaving by Machinery.</span>&#8212;<span
class="smcap">Mr. William Johnson</span>, of North Shields,
Joiner, has invented a shaving machine. This machine is of singular
construction, and contains every qualification necessary for the
process. In appearance it is not unlike an old-fashioned arm-chair.
But the most unique feature in the whole affair is the arrangement
of the razor blades, which are fixed longitudinally on cylinders,
from three to six inches in length, four on each cylinder, at an
angle of 60 degrees, with fine camel-hair brushes between; for you
are lathered and shaved at one and the same time, the lather being
slipped from the interior of the cylinders, which are hollow. The
machine is put in motion by the weight of the patient, the seat
gradually giving way beneath, and sinking with him until he reaches
the ground, when the operation is completed. The seat, rising
immediately it is released from his weight, is ready to commence
again without any preparation. A musical-box, of <span class="smcap">Mr.
 Johnson's</span>
construction, and capable of performing a great variety of airs, is
appended to the machine, and can be attached or detached according
to the pleasure of the person undergoing the operation, so that you
may be shaved to any tune you please! Experiments (says the
<i>Gateshead Observer</i>) have been tried and found
satisfactory."&#8212;<i>Durham Advertiser.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>We must confess, that, however ingenious this machine may be, we
should
feel very much in the same situation as the gentleman who was deposited
in the barrel of spikes before we took our seat amidst the cylinders,
with our face among a lot of razors, "four on each cylinder." As the
cylinders are "fixed," there can be no allowance for an extra amount of
cheek, an exuberance of lip, or protuberance of nose; but when the
"patient"&#8212;as he is very properly called&#8212;is once in for the operation,
he must take his chance as to the relative position of his features and
the fixed razors, nor must he think of being "nice to a shaving." When
the "patient" takes his seat off goes the machine, set in motion by his
weight, and stoppage seems to be out of the question until "he reaches
the ground, when the operation is completed." No wonder that the patient
should sink under an operation of such very alarming gravity, by the law
of which he comes to the floor with a degree of force commensurate to
the weight of his own body. The seat, having released itself from its
burden by shooting the "patient" on to the floor, is ready for another
victim.</p>

<p>We should hardly like to be operated upon by a single razor with our
chair trembling beneath us; but to find ourselves amidst a "forest of
blades"&#8212;four on each cylinder&#8212;with our seat giving way under us, would
be a position so frightful that it is one we hardly venture to
contemplate.</p>

<p>A shabby attempt appears to have been made to gloss over the more
alarming features of this infernal shaving machine, or guillotine, by
setting it to music. We hope the airs played by the box spoken of are
appropriate; and we should suggest the March in <i>Blue Beard</i> as
peculiarly fitted to a machine reminding one of beards and blood, of
soap and scimitars.</p>

<hr />

<h4>Not Cheap, but Extremely Nasty.</h4>

<p>Considering the tremendous sums we pay every year for drainage of the
metropolis, we must say that it is a luxury for the enjoyment of which
we have, in every sense, but smelling most especially, to pay largely
through the nose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Centralization.</span>&#8212;The Commissioners of

erroneously, an' mistakenly,

should like to have a set of
the rules of one or more of these Clubs, for we are puzzled to think
what amount of goosedom can be a qualification for membership. Surely
the Peace Society people must be honorary members for life of every
Goose-Club in the kingdom, if merit has its reward, and admittance to a
Goose-Club is to be obtained by personal gooseishness, or a
corresponding amount of quackery. We have heard that the manager of a
certain highly patronised theatre has consulted his solicitor upon the
advertisement of a Goose-Club near Oxford Street, with the view of
ascertaining whether the word goose is meant to apply to himself in a
libellous manner. The legal sage not being prepared, the Goose question

<h2>FORTUNE-TELLERS FOR NATIONS.</h2>

<p>What the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>&#8212;in a highly superior article on
"Church
Parties"&#8212;calls the "Prophetic Press," is now in a state of violent
eruption. The volcano in labour, however, brings forth only the bottle
of smoke. You can hardly take up your morning paper without being
invited, in the advertising columns, by some half-dozen several
expositors, to take so many new walks into futurity. The Overthrow of
the Papacy, the Destruction of the Ottoman Empire, the Battle of
Armageddon, the Millennium, demand your attention together with the last
novel, and <span class="smcap">Soyer's</span> Pantropheon, and the
Propriety of Legalising Marriage
with a Wife's Sister. It is a remarkable circumstance that the gentlemen
who announce these awful things, so calculated to wean the soul from all
earthly solicitudes, do not omit to affix prices to their productions.
Like common Gipsies, these reverend Romany require their hands to be
crossed with silver. This shows that whilst they direct the attention of
others to future certainties, they give no small share of their own to
the main chance. On that account we hesitate to compare them to <span
class="smcap">Mother
Shipton</span>, who was an old woman, or to <span class="smcap">Nixon</span>,
 who was an idiot. Otherwise
we should regard them as common asses, pretending to rank with the ass
of <span class="smcap">Balaam</span>.</p>

<p>French, Italian, German, without a Master, are studies not very
generally successful; and the language of prophecy must be rather more
difficult, independently of proper direction. Those who are inclined to
entertain the idea that <span class="smcap">Mr. Stiggins</span> and <span
 class="smcap">Mr. Chadband</span> are illuminated
expositors of <span class="smcap">Daniel</span> and the Apocalypse had
better pay a visit to <span class="smcap">Mr.
Wyld's</span> Great Globe, to acquire, if possible, some enlargement of
the
views of the world and the destinies of the human race. The patrons of
the "Prophetic Press" will find it best to await that explanation of
prophecy which is afforded by its fulfilment; but they will have to wait
a long time for any such thing in reference to the commentaries of
<span class="smcap">Chadband</span> and <span class="smcap">Stiggins</span>.</p>

<p>To infer the future from the past, however, is to prophesy with some
security. At all crises of the world's history have <span class="smcap">Chadbands</span>
 and
<span class="smcap">Stigginses</span> applied their prophetic wisdom to
the question of the day. At
all those times they have made money&#8212;and mistakes. On all similar
occasions in future will they, in precisely the same manner, succeed,
and&#8212;fail.</p>

<h2>A PEACEFUL SOLICITOR.</h2>

<p>A Guildford and guileless solicitor "and a Member of the Peace
Society,"
denounces all war as un-Christian. War at <i>no</i> price! He says, the
soldier disobeys the law of Christianity by killing a man. How about the
attorney? Does he obey the Christian law by helping to lock a man up? As
Christians, should we not be of charity and forgiveness all compact?
Does the solicitor make out his bill of costs according to the behest of
the Prince of Peace? Would our solicitor act in a cause of action for
unprovoked and brutal assault? Hardly, if he denounces "the soldier's
bloody calling" on every occasion. What is war but an action?&#8212;<span
class="smcap">Nicholas</span>
<i>v.</i> <span class="smcap">Abdul-Medjid.</span> The Cossack attacks
the Turk, and the Turk, whipping
out his scimetar, shaves off the Cossack's head. What is this but an
action&#8212;the Cossack, for the first assault, paying righteous costs?</p>

<p>Now, if the enemy were to march to Guildford, would "A Solicitor and a
Member of the Peace Society" open his door to the intruders,
saying&#8212;"Enter ye, who are heavy laden with ball-cartridge?"</p>

<p>Does our Solicitor give advice gratis against going to law; even as

<h4>Music, Malt, and Hops.</h4>

<p>Messrs. Bass and Co., the teetotallers will be glad to hear, have
published a circular in the name of the Burton Pale Ale Brewers,
announcing the intention of raising the price of their beer by 6<i>s</i>.
 per
cask. This concert among the Brewers, with a Bass for leader, exhibits
some novelties in harmony. The Bass rises instead of descending in the
scale of price, and by thus increasing in height, will, strange to say,
reach up to Double Bass. One more step will raise it to Treble Bass; but
that will be a contradiction in terms, and absolutely ridiculous.</p>

<h2>DR. CANTWELL'S INCOME-TAX MADE EASY.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Cantwell</span>&#8212;by appointment of the <span
class="smcap">Pope</span>, <span class="smcap">Lord Bishop of Meath</span>&#8212;has
written
 a letter to <span class="smcap">Mr. Pollard Urquhart</span>, M.P., to
inquire how far he,
the said <span class="smcap">Dr. Cantwell</span>, is liable to the
Income-Tax, inasmuch as he
appears to be prohibited, by the Ecclesiastical Titles' Act, from
returning himself under Schedule D as the recipient of any income by the
title of <span class="smcap">Bishop of Meath</span>. <span class="smcap">Mr.
 Urquhart</span>, who seems to be the <span class="smcap">Mawworm</span>
 to
the <span class="smcap">Cantwell</span>, answers, that he is rejoiced at
 any incident that has
tended to make more manifest the absurdity of the Ecclesiastical Titles'
Act; but that he is "unable to propound any solution of the difficulty,
and, indeed, thinks it would require a very wise man to do so." In that
opinion he may be correct; nevertheless the problem is very obviously
soluble to <i>Punch</i>.</p>

<p>All that <span class="smcap">Dr. Cantwell</span>&#8212;who declares himself
 "unwilling even to appear to
resist any law, however unjust and oppressive"&#8212;all that titular <span
class="smcap">Bishop
Cantwell</span> has to do&#8212;is simply to return himself as being in the
receipt
of an income in this country derived from an office which he holds under
a foreign power. What may be the denomination of that office he need not
state, unless he would wish to contribute to <span class="smcap">Her
Majesty's</span> Exchequer the
fine of a hundred pounds, in addition to the lesser penalty of
sevenpence in the pound.</p>

<p>It is not everybody that <i>Punch</i> would take the trouble of
teaching how
to place himself under Schedule D; but really <span class="smcap">Dr.
Cantwell</span> appears so
very anxious to pay his Income-Tax conscientiously, that <i>Mr. Punch</i>
cannot deny himself the pleasure of assisting the right reverend
gentleman in the discharge of that agreeable duty.</p>

<hr />

<h4>Synonymous Slang.</h4>

<p>The opinions of a certain eminent member of the Peace Society
respecting
the British Lion are calculated to render the phrase "Honour Bright,"
equivalent in popular estimation to "Hookey Walker."</p>

<hr />

<h2>THE DYE OF GUILT.</h2>

<p>The Kentucky Legislature have resolved&#8212;</p>

<blockquote><p>"That the keeper of the Penitentiary shall procure a
suitable
chymical dye, such as will stain the skin perfectly black, so that
it cannot be removed, until time shall wear it away, and Nature
furnish a new cuticle or surface."</p></blockquote>

<p>When the dye is obtained, the nose of each male convict is to be
painted
thoroughly black; the paint to be renewed until about to be restored to
the world, when the convict shall be restored to society with a clean
nose. We hardly perceive the moral and social use of this nose-dyeing;
it may also be difficult to obtain the dye of sufficient blackness. In
which case <i>Punch</i> advises Kentucky to apply to <span class="smcap">Mrs.
 Stowe</span> for the use
of her ink-bottle: for that lady has dyed not only the noses, but the
whole faces of the <span class="smcap">Legrees</span> with such
well-merited blackness, that Nature
must find them not only new skins, but new hearts, ere they can show
even tolerably white again.</p>

<hr />

<h2>AN ARMY OF RESERVE.</h2>

<p>The foreign correspondent of the <i>Times</i> announces that the
Porte has
issued an address, "calling on those troops whose courage may fail them
to avow the fact without hesitation, so that they may be employed at a
distance from the scene of combat." For our own parts, having more of
the civil than the military in our composition, we should expect the
invitation to be rather generally responded to, as the scenery of a
combat is of that kind with reference to which "distance lends
enchantment to the view." If the majority of the troops of the Porte
should make a "candid avowal" of their desire to remain at a respectful
distance from the scene of action, the whole affair might become "void
for remoteness"&#8212;as the lawyers expressively have it.</p>

<h2>OUR TOURIST IN PARIS.&#8212;No. 10</h2>

<p>If there is a point upon which an Englishman can dwell with pride, it
 is
the high character of the English press. He will never be more impressed
with this than when he turns over the French journals and examines the
matter of which they are made up. A little foreign politics, Paris
scandal, theatrical criticism, and a chapter of a vile novel. Fancy
taking up the <i>Times</i> and finding, instead of three solid leading
articles, a portion of <i>Jack Sheppard</i>, or <i>The Mysteries of the
Court
of St. James</i>, the debates cut down to an analysis, and no home or
foreign correspondence! The change would hardly be made agreeable to him
by the fact that the milk-and-water or poisonous contributions that did
appear were guaranteed by the name of the author of each, and that its
only polemics were waxed by some individual <span class="smcap">Smith</span>
 <i>eo nomine</i>, against
some individual <span class="smcap">Brown</span> of another paper. Yet
this prosecution against
libel is recommended by a public person (I was nearly saying a
statesman), who is "by way of being" a patriot, but wants to have a
monopoly of influence and vituperation in his own hands. However, it is
happily not of the least consequence what that disinterested politician
wants, for he certainly will not get it, as we cannot afford to part
with our Fourth Estate just yet, and suspect the motives of any one who
advises us to do so.</p>

<p>The Tourist makes these reflections with a little bitterness as he
sits
in a <i>café</i> waiting for breakfast. A beautiful lady, with a
ravishing
little cap on the back of her head, is sitting at the receipt of custom.
Two or three smart waiters with long clean aprons are bustling about in
attendance on an elderly benevolent looking gentleman, with an
impediment in his French, who has ultimately succeeded in ordering a
<i>chop de mutton</i> and <i>une bottel de Stout de Dublin</i>, solacing
 himself
meanwhile with <i>Galignani's Messenger</i>. Through a door is seen
another
saloon, where bearded men are drinking <i>eau sucré</i> and <i>liqueurs</i>.</p>

<p>The sage waiting for his chocolate turns again to the journals, and
gratifies himself by picking out the places where <span class="smcap">Théophile</span>
 or <span class="smcap">Alphonse</span>
or <span class="smcap">Eugène</span> pitches into the English. What a
useful thing it is to see
ourselves as others see us! We find out so much that we were ignorant
of. Your Tourist candidly confesses that he had no notion of the
wickedness and absurdity of his countrymen, or even of their manners and
customs, or the very localities of the country, until he read them,
detailed, in the pleasing pages of French feuilletonists. Until he read
<span class="smcap">M. Méry's</span> English sketches, he was ignorant,
and he boldly affirms that
many others are ignorant too, of such common facts as that English
gentlemen hire post-captains in the Royal Navy to sail their yachts;
that Greenwich hospital is a retreat for old soldiers; and that the late
<span class="smcap">Duke of Wellington</span>, when <span class="smcap">Colonel
 Wellesley</span>, was Governor-General of
India. He has selected one <i>feuilleton</i>, entitled "<span
class="smcap">Sir John Bull</span> <i>à
Paris</i>," for its masterly exposure of British foibles. It will be
sent
to you, translated by his little brother at <span class="smcap">Dr.
Swisham's</span>, Turnhambrown,
who has made great progress in French, and is sure to do it justice. <span
 class="smcap">Dr.
S.</span> says the boy's English is remarkably pure and idiomatic. The
author
is the well-known <span class="smcap">Hippolyte Canard</span>, whose <i>bon
 mots</i> are so successful,
and who wrote the noble apology for the massacres of February, which
gave such umbrage to the present despicable Government.</p>

<p>"I walk myself on the Boulevart. All the world regards me in smiling.
And for what? It is true that I have the insular air, at one time
respectable and ferocious. I carry the long <i>redingote</i>, the
scarlet
waistcoat, the pantaloon of nankeen, and the umbrella, peculiar to the
sons of Albion. <span class="smcap">John</span>, my jockey, follows me
clad in the traditional
costume which recalls the courses of Derby and Newmarket. With one hand
he holds '<i>the Times</i>,' this journal so powerful with which the
'gentlemens' voyage everywhere. With the other he retains my <i>bouledog</i>,
charming little beast, who testifies a lively desire to eat the calves
of the passengers. By what it seems, he recognises his hereditary
enemies.</p>

<p>"A sun of spring gilds with his young rays the boughs of the noble
trees
that like a scarf of green velvet border this so delicious promenade.
These good Parisians, veritable children of light and heat, sit at
tables outside the Coffee of Paris and the Coffee of the Cardinal, and,
refreshed by floods of sugar-and-water, play the national game of
dominoes. Cigars, fabricated of a tobacco denied to our sterile soil,
regale the nostrils with their astonishing perfume. Young and beautiful
ladies, dressed with an extreme elegance, attract upon themselves
admiring regards. Crowds of nurses lead children with heads of angel,
and hear all in blushing the compliments of soldiers in a red pantaloon.
In effect there is not but the braves who merit the belles.</p>

<p>"All respires gaiety, and however I feel my heart moved by a profound
sadness. Rhum and gin drunk at long draughts in the English manner fail
of their effect and inspire me with but a lugubrious gaiety. I am exiled
from all I love. I remember my youth spent among the solitary thickets
of Brompton and of Bethnal, and the savage mountains of Middlesex. I
miss the sport, the box, the chase with guns, the combats of dogs and
cocks. I long for my native land, its porter-beer, its rosbif, its
eternal mists, and its polismens. I have gained the spleen.</p>

<p>"Fatal and mysterious malady, which on the banks of the Thames
produces
effects so desolating! It is to thee that we owe those numerous suicides
of which the frightful details encumber our journals, a veritable black
page in the history of England. I hear on all sides a confused mixture
of strange voices, and the bizarre accents of the French tongue. It is
an affair of Babel. I am struck with a vertigo.</p>

<p>"When <span class="smcap">Jules de Prémaray</span>, writer of the
first force, visited Albion, he
was oppressed by a similar melancholy. He sighed for something of
French, a word even. Suddenly an ass began to bray, '<i>A la bonne
heure</i>,' exclaimed he with joy, '<i>en voilà un qui parle Français</i>.'
 He
knew his brother and was glad. It is not long before I receive an equal
consolation.</p>

<p>"I meet <span class="smcap">Lord Jones</span>, who comes from selling
 Miladi according to the usage
a little severe of the English <i>noblesse</i>, and has the air of being
pleased to find himself again a boy. With him is his son <span
class="smcap">Sir Jones</span>,
simple baronet, who has completed his studies at the ancient college of
Cambridge. I know them amidst the crowd by their stiffness, their
whiskers, their enormous white cravats, their hats with narrow borders,
reposed on the backs of their heads. It must be confessed our
compatriots have not the elegant <i>tournure</i> and mien full of
distinction
carried by the grand nation.</p>

<p>As I make my compliments to Milord, a movement of the crowd denotes
something of interest. We advance, followed always by the faithful <span
 class="smcap">John</span>.
I see a sight which recalls the innocent games of my country. Two cocks
combatted with indomitable fury. Their eyes sparkled like ardent coals.
They leaped by force of wings and tore themselves with beak and claw. It
was a spectacle to make fear, a strife to death! At length one fell. The
other, victor but bleeding, mounted on the corpse and chaunted his hymn
of triumph. My eyes wet themselves with tears.</p>

<p>"Wagram, Marengo, Austerlitz," said, with <i>brusquerie</i>, a
soldier who
observed my emotion.</p>

<p>"'Waterloo,' I proudly answered.</p>

<p>"'<span class="smcap">Blucher</span>, <span class="smcap">Sir Lowe</span>,'
 rejoined he, with dignity.</p>

<p>"I bite my lips."</p>

<hr />

<h4>Adieu, thou dreary Piles!</h4>

<p>Every one admits that Westminster Bridge is tumbling to pieces, and
yet,
strange to say, the evil report of the structure is scarcely to be
credited, for there is the weakest possible foundation to go upon.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>

<h2>WOMEN'S RIGHTS&#8212;MEN'S NOSES.</h2>

<p>The female members, advocating Women's Rights in New York, have had a
terrific engagement with <span class="smcap">Lloyd Garrison</span> and
others on the subject of
Christianity. Peace, love, and humility dissolved "in a grand row." The
ladies could not convince <span class="smcap">Lloyd Garrison</span>; and
 so one of their male
champions pulled his nose! This is truly the <i>argumentum ad hominem</i>.
 A
man's skull may be so dense that not even female arguments piercingly
delivered may penetrate to his brain; but if arguments be too subtle,
there is still the convincing thumb and finger. Missing a man's
conviction, the next noblest appeal to his reason is, unquestionably, to
pull his nose! We hear that a pair of silver gauntlets have been
presented by the Christian ladies to their champion who pulled the nose
of the stout <span class="smcap">Garrison</span>. Indeed, he pulled it
so vigorously, it was at
first thought he had quite carried it.</p>

<h2>BURGLARY AND BRONCHITIS PREVENTED.</h2>

<a href="images/177a.png">
<img src="images/177a.png" alt="BURGLARY AND BRONCHITIS PREVENTED"

</div>

<p>According to the ingenious <span class="smcap">Mr. Jeffreys</span>,
nobody should be without a
respirator in his hand to clap on his own mouth by way of extinguisher
to an incipient cough, or to pop on any unfortunate child who exhibits a
tendency to choke. The respirator seems to be of two kinds; the one
simply oral, which is calculated to check equally the wheeze of asthma
or the whistle of age, and the other, ori-nasal, adapted to nose and
mouth, so as to make it impossible either to sneeze or to snore.</p>

<p>According to the assertion of the inventor the Respirator is, in
fact, a
warm climate for five and sixpence; a portable Madeira that may be
always put to the mouth like an inexhaustible bottle, at the mere price
of the wine. Many gentlemen and ladies seem to have been starting for
warmer latitudes&#8212;one individual seems to have been on the top of the
'bus bound, <i>viá</i> Paddington, for Barbadoes, when, somebody having
recommended him a Respirator, he descended from the knife-board of a
City Atlas, rushed into a shop, where he laid out a few shillings, and
became the fortunate possessor of a warm climate, to be put on or taken
off <i>ad libitum</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 80%;">
<a href="images/177b.png">
<img src="images/177b.png" alt="persons in bed wearing respirators"
 width="100%" /></a>
</div>

<p>But perhaps the most valuable feature of the Respirator has been
hitherto overlooked, for it is as a defence against Burglary rather than
Bronchitis, that it will obtain the highest renown. Let any family go to
bed wearing Respirators, and we defy the boldest burglar to execute his
purpose if the family should be disturbed. <span class="smcap">Jack
Sheppard</span> himself, or any
other romantic ruffian, would start back with terror at the aspect of a
household armed all in Respirators, and presenting such a picture as one
of our artists has supplied. Or suppose the midnight marauder to have
made his way into the bed-room of a pair of parents lying with an infant
between them, the entire domestic trio wearing the frightful appendage
invented by <span class="smcap">Mr. Jeffreys</span>, we are convinced
that the panic-stricken
miscreant would shrink out of the "Chamber of Horrors," and proceed to
give himself up to justice at the nearest Police Station. We are
convinced that a Respirator would be as effectual in frightening away
burglars as a blunderbuss, or, rather, as an air-gun, to which, from its
effect on the breathing, the instrument may be aptly compared.</p>

<hr />

<h2>THE FAST MEN OF EDINBURGH.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Palmerston</span>&#8212;through his secretary&#8212;has
administered a very
wholesome rebuke to certain of the Presbytery of Edinburgh yearning,
hungering for a fast, to stay the scourge of the Cholera. His Lordship
suggests instead of fasting, washing. Eat your daily bread, says his
Lordship, only take plenty of soap with it. Attend to your own
dinner-table, as usual, only see that those places&#8212;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Which are inhabited by the poorest classes, and which,
from the
nature of things, must most need purification and improvement, may
be freed from those causes and sources of contagion which, if
allowed to remain, will infallibly breed pestilence, and be fruitful
in death, in spite of all the prayers and fastings of a united but
inactive nation. When man has done his utmost for his own safety,
then is the time to invoke the blessing of Heaven to give effect to
his exertions."</p></blockquote>

<p>Surely, this is very true. Prayers, however, earnest, will not
sweeten a
common sewer. Folks who fast for a long day will hardly do as much to
remove the causes of Cholera, as even folks with brooms. An empty belly
is scarcely so efficacious for the removal of disease as a clean Wynd.
Whitewashed walls are surely quite as good, if not better, than lank
jaws, pale with mortification. All Edinburgh wants a sweet clean shirt
next a clean skin&#8212;not a shirt of penitential bristles, clothing (with
hairy piety) a dirty hide. First do your best&#8212;says <span class="smcap">Palmerston</span>&#8212;and
 then
ask a blessing on it. For the days of miracles are over. The deadly reek
of sewers is not to be turned into airs from Heaven, though the most
pious <span class="smcap">Malachi Malagrowther</span> shall, for a long
day and night, go without
his porridge for it!</p>

<p>When you have worked, then it is good to ask a blessing on the
labour.
But hands first&#8212;and then, knees.</p>

<h4>A Lost Letter.</h4>

<p>An advertisement has appeared in the <i>Times</i>, headed "Wanted,
Left off
Clothing!" and directing the possessors of such articles to apply to
"<span class="smcap">Mr. 'Aked</span>." Looking to the character of the
want expressed, one would
imagine that by some typographical error the initial letter of the
gentleman's name had been omitted.</p>

<hr />

<h4>AN UNERRING BILLIARD PLAYER.</h4>

<p>How can the <span class="smcap">Pope</span> get anybody to play
billiards with him, unless he gets
a Protestant, or a heathen? Who else would expect to have any chance
with Infallibility?</p>

<hr />

<h4>Rather too Nice.</h4>

<p class="cap_3">WELL beloved, joyful am I to see you Britons&#8212;<i>penitus
 toto divisos orbe
Britannos</i>, as a friend near me says&#8212;returning or relapsing into
Paganism. So my altar, 'the altar of <span class="smcap">Hymen</span>,'
is at last erected in your
places of worship, is it? I had doubted whether the news could be true;
but I now read the statement so repeatedly in the <i>Morning Herald</i>,
 who
asserts herself to be the only exponent of religion (and Irish grammar),
that I doubt no longer The 'Hymeneal ceremony' is constantly performed
by your priests&#8212;so I read. <span class="smcap">Olympus</span>
rejoices&#8212;we all rejoice. My father,
<span class="smcap">Apollo</span>, has composed a capital song in honour
 of your conversion; and my
respected mother, <span class="smcap">Urania</span>, is making a new
star, which will be hung out
in a few nights in commemoration of the same. But, Well-beloved, there
is a good saying by <span class="smcap">Periander</span> of Corinth, '<i>Prius
 intellige, et deinde
ad opus accede.</i>' The 'Hymeneal Ceremonies' ought to be performed
accurately and properly, if at all, or <span class="smcap">Juno</span>
(between ourselves, a
stuck-up party) will show little favour to the nuptials. Instruct your
priests and officials, Well-beloved, and let us gods shortly read in the
<i>Morning Herald</i>, that you are not content with foolishly applying
Pagan
phrases to Christian facts, but that you are consistent. Something like
the following, eh?</p>

<h2>MARRIAGE RITES IN HIGH LIFE.</h2>

<center>(<i>From the Morning Herald.</i>)</center>

<p>The long talked of espousals of <span class="smcap">Lord Julius
Fitzmarlingspike</span> and the
lovely and accomplished <span class="smcap">Rosa Augusta</span>,
youngest daughter of his Grace the
<span class="smcap">Duke Of Bopps</span>, have at length come off. Some
delay was occasioned by the
gentlemen of the long robe, but the <i>Sponsalia</i> having been finally
perused and settled by the eminent barrister <span class="smcap">Chrysostom
 Silvertongue,
Q.C.</span>, were engrossed on the <i>Legitimæ Tabellæ</i>, and were
sealed on
<span class="smcap">Woden's</span> day last. <span class="smcap">Lord
Julius</span> took the opportunity of presenting his
betrothed with a splendid <i>Annulus Pronubus</i> of diamonds
alternating
with emeralds, expressly manufactured by the talented jewellers, <span
class="smcap">Runt</span>
and <span class="smcap">Hoskell</span>. There was a difficulty in fixing
 the marriage day, there
being so many unlucky days, and <i>Atri</i>, in this month's kalendar,
and
<i>Salii</i> and the <i>Parentalia</i> festivals approaching. But
yesterday having
been selected, the lovely bride was dressed in a long white robe
bordered with purple fringe, or embroidered ribbons (we could hardly say
which), bound with a girdle of wool, and tied, of course, with the
time-honoured <i>Nodus Herculeus</i>. Her face was covered with a
flame-coloured veil, denoting modesty, and her beautiful hair having
been divided into six locks with the point of a spear (kindly lent from
the New Zealand Museum), was crowned with flowers supplied from a
well-known <i>bouquetière</i> in Covent Garden. Her shoes were of the
same
colour as her veil. The auspices had been duly consulted, and a very
fine hog having been sacrificed to <span class="smcap">Juno</span> (the
animal was supplied from
the long-established styes of <span class="smcap">Messrs. Chitterlings
and Co.</span>), the omens
from its inside were pronounced very favourable. We must not omit to
record a <i>bon mot</i> of the bride, which shows that she possesses all
 the
wit for which her <i>spirituel</i> family has been so long celebrated.
On the
question at the espousals being put to her, "<i>An spondes?</i>" she
instantly replied, with an arch smile, "<i>Spondeo, sed nomen meum non
est</i> <span class="smcap">Anne</span>." The marriage ceremony was
performed at the house of the <span class="smcap">Duke
of Bopps</span>, but in the evening the bride was conducted to her
husband's
<i>domus</i>. Three boys, whose parents were alive, attended her, two
holding
her by the arms, and one flourishing a link, which we regret was made
the subject of ribald remark by the other boys in the street. The
maid-servants followed with distaff, spindle, and wool, and a boy from
the Lowther Arcade bore the playthings&#8212;the <i>crepundia</i>&#8212;for the
family
with which it is to be hoped <span class="smcap">Rosa</span> will be
blessed. The boys let off more
than usually good <i>sales et couvicia</i>, which is accounted for by <i>Mr.
Punch</i> having kindly undertaken to supply the jokes for the day. On
arriving in Park Lane, the house of <span class="smcap">Lord
Fitzmarlingspike</span> was found
tastefully adorned with leaves and flowers, and the rooms with tapestry.
<span class="smcap">Rosa</span>, being asked by <span class="smcap">Lord
 Julius</span> who she was, replied, in a firm voice,
"<i>Ubi tu</i> <span class="smcap">Caius</span>, <i>ibi ego</i> <span
class="smcap">Caia</span>," and immediately bound the door-posts
with woollen fillets, supplied by <span class="smcap">Madame Crinoline</span>,
 of Bond Street. She
was lifted over the threshold, touched fire and water&#8212;a wax lucifer and
some <i>Eau de Cologne</i> doing the symbolic duty&#8212;the nuptial song,
written
by <span class="smcap">M. Catnach</span>, and composed by <span
class="smcap">M. Costa</span>, was sung; <span class="smcap">Lord Julius</span>
 scattered
nuts (best Barcelona, from <span class="smcap">Shadrack's</span>) among
the boys; and then several
matrons, who had been married but once (the <span class="smcap">Hon.
Mrs. Jones</span>, the <span class="smcap">Hon.
Mrs. Brown</span>, and the <span class="smcap">Hon. Mrs. Robinson</span>),
 singing all the way, conducted
the happy bride to the nuptial bower, which was erected in the hall, and
covered with flowers. Young women sang outside the house until midnight,
when they were ordered off by the Police. The second entertainment, the
<i>Nepotia</i>, will be given this day. We should add that the ceremony
was
impressively performed by the <span class="smcap">Hon.</span> and <span
class="smcap">Rev. Pontifex Maximus</span>, assisted
by the <span class="smcap">Haruspex Bobbus Montgomeriensis</span>.</p>

<h2>PLAYHOUSE PEGS.</h2>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/178b.png" alt="A" class="cap" width="30%" />

<p class="cap_3">THE <i>Morning Post</i>, by a Correspondent, begs to
call the earnest
attention of an emotional public to the use and abuse of a wooden peg at
the Princess's Theatre, "for the accommodation of a lady's bonnet." That
bonnets are the source of a multitude of evils is a truth that every
married man will not, for a moment, hesitate to avouch; however <span
class="smcap">Henry</span> or
<span class="smcap">Augustus</span>&#8212;not yet married&#8212;may hypocritically
venture to dispute. Now a
bonnet at the Princess's Theatre&#8212;according to the <i>Post</i>
correspondent&#8212;carries with it a peculiar worth: namely, price sixpence.
On the 25th instant at half-past 9, the dress-circle of the Princess's
"less than half-full," a lady was required to give up her bonnet. Well
and good. That bonnet was hung upon a peg. As bonnets are now worn, a
bonnet, for that matter, might be hung upon nothing. When the bonnet was
reclaimed, the complaining gentleman proffered 4<i>d.</i>, which was
"indignantly rejected. Nothing less than sixpence could be taken;" which
being given, the gentleman remarks commercially "that 6<i>d.</i> per
evening
is too heavy a rate to exact for the use of a peg."</p>
</div>

<p>By no means. At least, not at the Princess's Theatre: there, the
whole
management is a management of pegs. What is poor <span class="smcap">Byron</span>
 made of, but a
peg&#8212;a mere peg&#8212;whereon to hang the fine clothes of a <i>Sardanapalus</i>?
Plays, as mere plays, are not to be thought of; but pegs&#8212;pegs that will
hold any number of fine suits, any weight of canvas. In fact, the peg is
the play.</p>

<p>To return to the bonnet peg, it may be advisable for good
housewives&#8212;visiting the Princess's&#8212;to follow the advice of <span
class="smcap">Miss
Martineau</span> to travellers. She says: Fail not to take a few
gimblets; they
serve on board ship admirably for pegs. Perhaps the manager of the
Princess's will make it known in future bills whether ladies with
bonnets visiting his theatre may be permitted to bring their own
gimblets.</p>

<h4>A Devouring Flame.</h4>

<p>Three removes, it is said, are as bad as a fire; but a fire is not so
bad as an extravagant woman, by many removes. The one simply burns you
out of house, but the other, if she is your wife, burns you out of both
house and home; and then again, you may put out the former, but, as long
as you have a place to live in, you have no chance of putting out the
latter.</p>

<h2>EVERY CONVICT HIS OWN CHESTERFIELD.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. John Mitchel</span>&#8212;by the astute and
graceful manner with which he
resigned his "comparative liberty," revoking his "parole of
honour"&#8212;displayed a politeness that would have charmed <span
class="smcap">Lord
Chesterfield</span>, and a casuistry that would have ravished <span
class="smcap">Ignatius Loyola</span>.
Determined upon escaping from bondage&#8212;(for which we say the smallest
blame to him)&#8212;he nevertheless resolved to escape like a gentleman. He
would resign his "comparative liberty" gracefully, as a bride resigns
her hand&#8212;he would revoke his parole smilingly, as a high-bred
cardplayer would revoke at whist. He enters the police-office&#8212;walks
into the magistrate's room&#8212;gives him a bit of paper. "What's this?"
asks the magistrate. "That's to signify," says <span class="smcap">John
Mitchel</span>, "that you
may chain me&#8212;lock me up." "May I, indeed!" cried the magistrate. "You
may," answers the magnanimous patriot; who, disdaining to take the least
advantage, bolts from the court, jumps on a horse ready saddled for the
work, and gallops his hardest.</p>

<p>We have heard of splitting a hair; but never before was word of
man&#8212;parole of honour&#8212;broken with such nicety. The flaw is so delicate,
it is hard to say where it begins or ends. In future, perhaps, when an
Irish convict gentleman waits upon an Australian magistrate, to
surrender, on paper, his "comparative liberty," the magistrate, before
perusing the document, will take the precaution of shutting the
office-door.</p>

<h4>The Milky Way in Lancashire.</h4>

<p>Many of the farmers about Preston are giving their cows apples, in
consequence of that fruit being more plentiful, and so much cheaper,
than potatoes. We wonder whether this difference of diet produces any
difference in the milking; and whether a cow, so fed, instead of
yielding so many pints of milk, gives now so many bottles of cider; or
whether it was a combination of both&#8212;a sort of milk-cider? In the cause
of temperance, we pause for a reply.</p>

<h2>PAYING CULPRITS THROUGH THE NOSE.</h2>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/179b.png" alt="W" class="cap" width="30%" />

<p class="cap_3">WE see that old Kentucky is going ahead in the practice
 of humanity
towards an unfortunate and degraded class of beings. Witness the <i>New
York Journal of Commerce</i>, which contains the subjoined paragraph:&#8212;</p>
</div>

<blockquote><p>"<span class="smcap">Marking Convicts.</span>&#8212;A
resolution has been introduced into the
Kentucky Legislature, which provides 'that the keeper of the
Penitentiary shall procure a suitable chymical dye, such as shall
stain the cuticle or outer surface of the skin perfectly black, so
that it cannot be washed off, or in any way removed until time shall
wear it away, and Nature furnish a new cuticle or surface; and that
with this dye he shall have the nose of each male convict painted
thoroughly black, and renew the application as often as it may be
necessary to keep it so until within one month of the expiration of
his sentence, when it shall be discontinued for the purpose of
permitting Nature to restore the feature to its original hue
preparatory to the second advent of its owner into the world.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>It has long been the reproach of America that she has one law for the
blacks, and another for the whites. This is in one sense the case in
Kentucky; but there the advantage is on the side of the blacks. It is
quite obvious that the project for staining the noses of malefactors
black would not be feasible in the case of negroes: at least, in that
case, it would be a scheme analogous to that of gilding refined gold, if
not of painting the lily. That equal justice might lay hold of the
nigger's nose, it would be necessary to resort to a converse expedient,
and colour the African proboscis white. But for this purpose nothing
could be used but a mere pigment; for Chemistry does not supply any
substance which would have the effect of bleaching, even temporarily,
the blackamoor's skin. If that science could afford such a cosmetic, it
would emancipate several millions of persons in America, who are
deprived of their liberty and their rights as men for no other crime
than their complexion, but who might obtain their freedom as easily as
insolvent debtors if they could only manage to procure some sort of wash
by which they might be whitewashed.</p>

<h2>A THEATRICAL TITLES' BILL WANTED.</h2>

<p>We have had an Ecclesiastical Titles' Bill to prevent things from
being
called by any but their right names; and we are now about to suggest the
passing of a Theatrical Titles' Bill, with the view of putting a stop to
an assumption of certain high-sounding styles and dignities in the
dramatic world, which are becoming offensive to the common sense of our
countrymen. "His Eminence," as applied to <span class="smcap">Cardinal
Wiseman</span>, may be
ridiculous enough, but it is even still more absurd, when usurped as it
is, by a number of so-called "eminent" tragedians. There is scarcely a
theatrical hole or corner in London that does not advertise its
possession of the services of some "eminent" individual, whose
"mummeries" are quite as objectionable as those complained of in the
Popish priesthood. We suspect, however, that some of the objectionable
titles are conferred on the parties without their own consent; and we
feel convinced that our honest friend, <span class="smcap">Mr. John
Cooper</span>&#8212;the comic
representative of <i>Henry the Eighth</i>, and the original <i>Bumps</i>
 in
<i>Turning the Tables</i>&#8212;can never have given his adhesion to the
bigotry
and superstition of Exeter Hall, whose concert conductors have
advertised him as the "eminent tragedian."</p>

<h2>CRUEL TREATMENT OF THE POOR AND LOWLY.</h2>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/180a.png" alt="A" class="cap" width="30%" />

<p class="cap_3">Although we are aware that the contemplated evil will
be perpetrated too
late for the interference of <i>Punch</i>: nevertheless, for the sake of
future coachmen and footmen of future Lord Mayors, we must indignantly
protest against the cruelty exercised by <span class="smcap">Lord Mayor
Sidney</span> on his
hapless vassals! Will it be believed that&#8212;with the City corporation in
<i>articulo mortis</i>&#8212;the Lord Mayor's coachman and footmen are for the
first time to be "in rich Genoa velvet!" The colour a beautiful
gunpowder green, "with a scarlet bordering of the same material!" There
are moreover to be "hundreds of yards of gold lace," the pattern
continuous sprigs of the tea-plant! "Gorgeous aiguillettes of unusual
length" (according to the ears of the corporation) "terminating with
rich bullion balls;" an improvement that might have been reserved for
any future Lord Pawnbroker. "In addition to the rich bullion wings on
the shoulders"&#8212;the left arm will bear the family crest. Only think of
<span class="smcap">Jeames</span> with wings! How beautifully does the
notion illustrate <span class="smcap">Milton</span>!&#8212;</p>
</div>

<div class="poem1"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"So dear to Heav'n is humble May'ralty,</p>
<p class="i0">That when a <span class="smcap">Sidney's</span> found
sincerely so</p>
<p class="i0">A thousand liveried angels lacquey him!"</p>
</div></div>

<p>Besides the wings, the gorgeous creatures will carry <span
class="smcap">Sidney's</span> arms and
crest, "a porcupine with six mullions!" The porcupine has quills of real
gold&#8212;no other quills being used in the <span class="smcap">Sidney</span>
 ledger. In addition to
this, the hats of coachman and footmen will be constructed in the form
of magnificent tea-pots; made of solid silver, thickly gilt.</p>

<p>All this is very splendid; but what is to become of the poor men,
their
year of glory out? Two of the footmen&#8212;after only trying on their
wings&#8212;gave signs of incipient insanity; declaring they "felt themselves
all over cherubims and no mistake." If, in November, 1854, three of
these winged flunkies be found perfectly sane, <span class="smcap">Lord
Sidney</span> may be
thankful. In the meanwhile, can he ever pass Bedlam, without a tender
feeling for the future destiny of his footmen and coachman?</p>

<p>Certain civic enthusiasts glorify <span class="smcap">Lord Sidney</span>
 for the grandeur that
seems to be intended as a fine defiance&#8212;like a gilt lion&#8212;of the
Corporation Commission. The cause for which <span class="smcap">Sidney</span>
 bleeds in his
tailor's bill is, no doubt, a cause very dear to aldermen and
councilmen; and it is expected that, emulating his Lordship, they will
on the present ninth&#8212;as it may be the <i>last</i> show&#8212;die gloriously;
dying like dolphins in surpassing colours.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, we trust that a watchful eye will be kept upon the angelic
footmen and archangelic coachman. What have they done, poor fellows!</p>

<h2>NOBLE CONDUCT OF MESSRS. COBDEN AND BRIGHT.</h2>

<p>Having recently had a slight corvine plucking with <span
class="smcap">Mr. Cobden</span> and <span class="smcap">Mr.
Bright</span>, <i>Mr. Punch</i> has the more pleasure in bearing
testimony to their
noble conduct in reference to the strike disturbances at Wigan.</p>

<p>As soon as <span class="smcap">Mr. Cobden</span> was informed of
these painful outbreaks, he laid
aside a pamphlet which he is writing, to prove that Russia never went to
war with anybody, and he hurried off to <span class="smcap">Mr. Bright</span>.
 He found the latter
busily arranging the library which has recently been presented to him
for his anti-Corn Law exertions; and that gentleman, hastily dashing
down a fine copy of "<i>Boxiana</i>," which he was reading with great
zest,
got into his friend's carriage.</p>

<p>"I think," said <span class="smcap">Mr. Cobden</span>, with one of
his frank smiles, "that we, who
have shown that everything can be arranged by diplomacy, have assailed
everybody for not settling differences by arbitration, and have so often
vaunted the superiority of the cultivated town operative over the
agricultural dolt, would hardly like to be accused of allowing thousands
of our own disciples to rise in riot close to our own doors, without
interfering and arguing with them."</p>

<p>"By Jove!&#8212;I mean verily," said <span class="smcap">Mr. Bright</span>,
 nearly smashing the carriage
window in his energy, "I should like any dastard to say that I sneaked
out of such an affray."</p>

<p>The missionaries of peace and political economy went pleasantly on,
reached Wigan, had the military sent away, and convoked the populace.
<span class="smcap">Mr. Cobden</span> then explained to the rioters that
 a question of wages was
not to be settled by violence, and invited them to a peaceful
discussion; and <span class="smcap">Mr. Bright</span>, in the kindest
manner, offered to fight
anybody who was irrational. Their appeals were successful, and after
three hours of peaceful talk, <span class="smcap">Messrs. C. &amp; B.</span>
 went off to the employers
with proposals, enforcing them by sound argument. They were accepted,
and the whole population have returned to work.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Punch</i> has not often the happiness of agreeing with the <i>Morning
Herald</i>, but is bound to express his gratitude to that journal for
having called his attention to the above noble and courageous conduct of
<span class="smcap">Messers. Cobden</span> and <span class="smcap">Bright</span>,
 who have now shown that they are not mere
empty theorists and platform spouters, but honest, consistent friends of
peace.</p>

<h2>HANOVER IN BRONZE.</h2>

<p>The House of Hanover does not shine very much in bronze. All our
statues
of the departed greatness of that House are marvellously little. The
best point of <span class="smcap">George the Third</span> is his
pigtail; whilst his son, <span class="smcap">George
the Fourth</span>, looks and sits his steed in Trafalgar Square like an
over-fed ostler above his business. The <span class="smcap">Duke of York</span>&#8212;a
 monument at
which every insolvent touches his hat in sympathetic reverence&#8212;is,
however, to come down. This we learn to be decided upon in the very
highest quarters&#8212;a truth whispered at the fireplaces of the Clubs.
<span class="smcap">Prince Albert</span> is to have a statue in Hyde
Park: and the men who propose
the monument (not that they can want bronze) are to have placed at their
disposal, as old metal, the whole of the York Pillar and Royal effigies.
Thus the <span class="smcap">Duke of York</span> will duly go to the
melting-pot, the only manner
in which there is any chance of his liquidating the debts he has left
behind him.</p>

<p><i>King.</i> Austria requires peace. In fact, the interests of
humanity
demand peace. France wants peace, Belgium wants peace, Saxe-Coburg wants
peace; and Saxe-Gotha wants peace!</p>

<p><i>Prince.</i> How wild the dogs are this morning! To be sure,
Saxe-Gotha.</p>

<p><i>King.</i> And England.&#8212;for I am more than half an Englishman, my
dear
<span class="smcap">Albert</span>&#8212;England wants peace. Think of your
debt. Eight hundred millions!
A sum enough to strike the house of <span class="smcap">Rothschild</span>
 flat into gold-leaf.
Eight hundred millions, <i>mon cher</i>, and Europe in a blaze. How do
you
know your eight hundred wouldn't be doubled?</p>

<p><i>Prince.</i> Twice eight's sixteen.</p>

<p><i>King.</i> Exactly. I saw a passage in the papers about some wild
Indians
who fire golden balls. Why, doesn't England always fire golden balls?
Load with lead and iron; and don't taxes turn 'em to gold?</p>

<p><i>Prince.</i> <span class="smcap">Aberdeen</span> the respectable
says the same.</p>

<p><i>King.</i> <span class="smcap">Aberdeen's</span> a great statesman.
 That is, he's great in his
respectability. And the English&#8212;I know the noble islanders&#8212;the English
are so devoted to a respectable Minister, that they'd rather be
half-ruined by respectability, than saved and served by anything that's
brilliant. They fear brilliancy, as it is said <span class="smcap">James
 the First</span> winced at
a drawn sword.</p>

<p><i>Prince.</i> To be sure, <span class="smcap">Palmerston</span>&#8212;</p>

<p><i>King.</i> A firebrand, <i>mon cher</i>: but now excellently
disposed of.
However, for the peace of Europe&#8212;</p>

<p><i>Prince.</i> Mark! [<i>Fires; bird falls.</i>]</p>

<p><i>King (to dogs).</i> Down charge! But for the peace of Europe <span
 class="smcap">Pam</span> is
capitally placed. It is all right to have a firebrand in the Home
Office, so long as you keep a Wet Blanket in the first place of the
Treasury.</p>

<p><i>Prince.</i> Peace is certainly to be desired. You have not seen my
picture&#8212;an allegory of Peace?</p>

<p><i>King.</i> I have. &#8212;&#8212; showed it me yesterday. My dear <span
class="smcap">Albert</span>, do let me
have a copy&#8212;nay two copies, by your own hand; one for Austria, one for
Russia; they will be delighted. Such "material guarantees" for the peace
of Europe; and peace at any price will be cheaper than ever.</p>

<p><i>Prince.</i> <span class="smcap">Aberdeen</span> deplores war. He
said at the Council on Tuesday, when
<span class="smcap">Molesworth</span> talked about national honour, and
shedding blood, and all
that&#8212;he said: It is better to have your nose pulled, than your nose cut
off. Now England has certainly had its nose pulled&#8212;</p>

<p><i>King.</i> But has not lost an inch of it. The nose is quite as
good as
ever, and then&#8212;</p>

<p><i>Prince.</i> Down, Pompey! How wild the dogs are!</p>

<p><i>King.</i> And then, with war, what throne is safe?
Hungary&#8212;Italy&#8212;Rome&#8212;Naples&#8212;</p>

<p><i>Prince.</i> The dogs are very wild!</p>

<p><i>King.</i> And as I've said, <i>mon cher</i>, Saxe-Coburg and
Saxe-Gotha.
Therefore, why not let Russia keep the Provinces, and&#8212;</p>

<p><i>Prince.</i> Here come <span class="smcap">Brabant</span> and <span
 class="smcap">Flanders</span>.</p>

<p><i>King.</i> Mark! (<i>His Majesty fires; bird falls. The</i> <span

<i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Count of Flanders</span> <i>join</i>).</p>

<h4>CHINESE HUMANITY.</h4>

<p>The Chinese Imperial general offered to his soldiers two dollars a
head&#8212;the head duly cut off&#8212;of the enemy. Well, the enemy not
forthcoming, the gallant soldiers took off the heads of their friends.
The heads becoming cumbrous from their number, the general declared that
he would be sufficiently satisfied with the instalment of ears.
Whereupon the gallant Chinese accosted the villagers, men and women, in
Shaksperian utterance&#8212;"Lend us your ears," and they granted the loan as

<h2>A CLOSE CONTRIVANCE AT WINCHESTER!</h2>

<div class="figleft2 t" style="width: 50%">
<img src="images/182a.png" width="100%" alt="ornament top" />
</div>

<p>LD Winchester&#8212;as most people know, and the rest may
have heard&#8212;has a
noble Cathedral. But what is the noblest Cathedral in the possession of
an ignoble clergy? A temple inhabited by owls and bats&#8212;infested with
rats and mice; stupid, crawling, disagreeable and voracious creatures.</p>

<div class="figleft2 b" style="width: 40%;">
<img src="images/182b.png" alt="Lower half of ornate capital
letter" width="100%" />
</div>

<p>Winchester Cathedral, however, rejoices under the guardianship of a
body
of divines of whom it may fearlessly be asserted that they neither hoot
nor squeak, nor fly on any wings but those of devotion, nor offend the
external senses, nor nibble to any extent that is uncapitular.</p>

<p>Some Chapters&#8212;the excellent <span class="smcap">Dean of Winchester</span>
 is stricken in years,
and for the present management of the affairs of the Cathedral, renown
and honour are probably due altogether to his subordinates&#8212;, some lazy
indifferent Chapters, content themselves with keeping the glorious
buildings bequeathed to them by the great churchmen of the Middle Ages
in simple repair. This may, indeed, include ornamental restorations. But
here they stop. Averse to progress, these prebendal sloths do nothing
whatever to improve their cathedrals, by alterations and embellishments
in accordance with the feelings and wants of the age.</p>

<p>Sluggish indifference like this is not to be cast, in the teeth of
those
high-minded and liberal clergymen, the Chapter of Winchester. We are
informed that they have lately enriched the interior of that majestic
edifice with additional features, which, whilst subservient to utility,
have, at the same time, the high æsthetical merit of embodying, or
symbolising the canonical spirit of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>Double rows of iron hurdles, surmounted by <i>chevaux-de-frise</i>,
have been
placed by these magnanimous dignitaries across the aisles of the
Cathedral.</p>

<p>We are sorry to say that a correspondent, writing from Winchester, is
 so
disrespectful as to suggest a motive for the erection of these barriers
of a nature unclerical, if not unworthy. He supposes that the reverend
gentry of the Close have taken to sporting, and as neither custom, nor
the agriculturists to whom the meadows belong, would allow them to ride
steeple-chases in the valley of the Itchen, they have set up
"bullfinchers" within their own bounds, in order to prosecute the chase
of the steeple within the church.</p>

<hr />

<h2><i>PUNCH</i> THE ONLY RECOGNISED PROMOTER OF LITERATURE.</h2>

<p>A wholesome caution has just been administered to self-styled
Literary
Institutions, which claim exemption from Poor Rate by the assumption of
a title which they do not carry out. At the Bath Quarter Sessions a set
of persons calling themselves the Bath Literary and Scientific
Institution, had the effrontery to make a claim to freedom from
taxation; and on the question being put to one of the witnesses&#8212;"Is
<i>Punch</i> taken in at the Institution?" the reply was in the
negative.
This of course settled the point as to the Society being one for the
advancement of literature; and the Sessions instantly decided against
the claim.</p>

<p>We hope Literary Societies in general will take a note of this
important
decision, which lays it down, on legal authority, that the taking in of
<i>Punch</i> is satisfactory evidence of an intention to promote
literature.
The Bath chaps who sought exemption on insufficient grounds, have
received a lesson which we trust will not be lost on those who fail to
"mind their <i>Punch</i>," and who fancy themselves promoters of
literature
without qualifying themselves by that test which is now recognised by a
legal tribunal as decisive, and will, we hope, find its way into "the
Books" as soon as possible.</p>

<h4>The City Coaxing the Crown.</h4>

<p>Those renowned gourmands, the Corporation of the City of London, have
got up a new dish, in the hope that it may prove a "pretty dish to set
before the <span class="smcap">Queen</span>;" adulation dished up as a
sort of curry or attempt at
currying of favour with an illustrious Prince. By their proposal to
erect a statue to <span class="smcap">Prince Albert</span> during his
lifetime, they will not,
however, succeed in the scheme of cajoling the Crown to interfere
between their corruptions and reform; and the meal they propose for the
acceptance of His Royal Highness will prove a mess. They had better
relinquish their endeavours to add lustre to the reputation of the
Prince, and transfer their attention to his boots.</p>

<h4>INGENIOUS PROTECTION AGAINST MIDGES&#8212;A VALUABLE HINT TO

</div>

<hr />

<h2>A REGULAR NUISANCE.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Punch</span> has long ago been appointed, by
and under his own act,
Inspector-General of Nuisances, and he may certainly take credit for the
removal of a great many nuisances long before the legislature gave its
attention to the subject.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Punch</i> has lately been engaged in the inspection of the
great City
of London Corporation Nuisance, and refers to the annexed report for the
result of his observations:</p>

<h4>REPORT.</h4>

<p>My attention was first drawn to the Corporation Nuisance by the very
bad
odour surrounding the locality, and by a very general rumour that an
offensive body, in a most alarming state of corruption, was lying within
the precincts of the City of London.</p>

<p>I accordingly proceeded to visit the spot, where a lamentable scene
presented itself. I found some four-and-twenty individuals huddled, or,
rather, closeted together, in one room, surrounded by a quantity of
refuse vegetable and animal matter (apparently composed of pine-apple
and venison), the effluvium from which was of the most deleterious
character. On examining further, I found a large quantity of thick
fluid, in the midst of which were several portions of a glutinous green
turtley material, and over the surface a sort of coating had formed,
which might almost be cut with a knife&#8212;so thick was the matter that had
settled on the top of the stagnant liquid. This deleterious wash had
been placed in vessels resembling soup-tureens, and was no doubt
intended for removal, a great deal of it having been already got rid of
by the persons assembled in the room, who appear, however, to have been
unable to proceed further with their disgusting operation. I found them
in a state of considerable exhaustion among the refuse stuff, and there
can be no doubt that the condition in which they are living is highly
injurious to the health&#8212;moral as well as physical&#8212;and likely to
exercise a most contaminating influence on the surrounding atmosphere.</p>

<p>In pursuance of this report <i>Mr. Punch</i> feels it his duty to
order the
removal of the nuisance within a reasonable time, for the parties have
been so frequently warned that there is little hope they will of
themselves proceed to abate the evils that have so long been matter of
public notoriety. <i>Mr. Punch</i> intends proceeding to inspect other
departments of the great City of London Corporation Nuisance, and to
persevere until a clean bill of health can be presented.</p>

<hr />

<h2>ARISTOCRACY AND ITS ANTIPODES.</h2>

<p>If the Legislative Council of New South Wales are enabled to effect
their proposal for the creation of an hereditary Peerage in that colony,
it will be necessary to assign armorial bearings to the new noblemen.
This will be no very difficult matter; respect being had to the origin
of the chief families that will be comprised in that aristocracy. For
example, here is the blazon of a coat that might be borne by the name of
<span class="smcap">Sikes</span>, elevated to the Dukedom of Norfolk
Island.</p>

<p><i>Gules</i>, on a cross <i>ermine</i>, between four hand-cuffs, <i>or</i>,
 a jemmy of
the field. Crest, out of a window shutter <i>vert</i> a hand, <i>sable</i>,
grasping a centre-bit <i>proper</i>.</p>

<p>The above coat will readily be seen to indicate that the founder of
the
bearer's family had been transported for burglary accompanied by
violence. The latter feature of his achievements is denoted by the
sanguinary colour of the field, and of the implement depicted on the
centre of the scutcheon. By the number of the handcuffs are signified
two convictions. The cross alludes to crossing the herring-pond, and the
ermine indicates the judicial sentence by which the voyage was
prescribed. The crest speaks for itself; the use of the term sable is an
allowable liberty, as being necessary to represent the probable state of
the member to which it is applied, considered in relation to soap and
water. The family motto might be, <i>Mortuus vivo</i>, which would be a
neat
paraphrase of "Death Recorded."</p>

<p>The horse, the sheep, the pig, and other cattle&#8212;for stealing which
the
forefathers of the ennobled parties were relegated&#8212;would furnish
abundance of animal forms for the purposes of heraldic symbolism. To
these might be added the magpie, the stoat, the weasel, and other
creatures that are the emblems of theft and larceny. Though, for the
matter of that, the more ancient devices of eagles, dragons, griffins,
lions, and the like beasts and birds of prey, would do quite
sufficiently well to glorify exploits of plunder and rapine; nor could
any motto for the member of a Botany Bay nobility be more suitable than
some of those very professions of ancestral principle, which are the
glory of certain high pedigrees among ourselves. "Thou shall want ere I
want," for instance, would precisely suit the descendant of a footpad. A
convict who had become a prosperous gentleman, after having completed
his sentence of transportation for seven years, could not have left a
happier legend to his posterity, than "I bide my time." Moreover, when
it is considered that the foundation of not a few among our own great
houses was either fraud or force, it cannot be asserted that a Peerage
of New South Wales would not rest to a considerable extent on a like
basis with the British nobility. So that, when you come to think it,
there may not be so very much difference, after all, between those who
came in with the Conqueror, and those who went out in the convict ship.</p>

<h2>THE SHERIFFS' DINNERS AT NEWGATE.</h2>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/185.png" alt="T" class="cap" width="30%" />

<p class="cap_3">THE Sessions of the Central Criminal Court have lost
much of their
attraction&#8212;especially to a hungry Old Bailey Bar, some of whom are
dreadfully open-mouthed&#8212;by the cutting down of the dinners usually
given by the Sheriffs. It seems that the learned Judges have not as yet
had any dinner at all in the City, but have been obliged to be satisfied
with a rather substantial "lunch," by way of substitute. The two
Sheriffs have been at loggerheads, and one of them&#8212;<span class="smcap">Mr.
 Wallis</span>&#8212;has
provided a meal to which he has invited only the Aldermen on the rota
instead of the whole body; upon which <span class="smcap">Sheriff Wire</span>
 fearing lest his
brother Aldermen should starve, has started an opposition table. In the
mean time the Judges have been making a meagre lunch with one Sheriff
and dining with neither. There being, however, two lunches a day, and
two opposition dinners, we should be glad to know how the worthy
Chaplain of Newgate performs his elaborate duty of partaking of every
meal, which he must necessarily do, in order to avoid giving offence to
either of the opposition Sheriffs. The reverend ordinary will have the
extraordinary task of disposing of two lunches and two dinners in
four-and-twenty hours&#8212;an accomplishment that calls to mind the old
familiar feat of the leg of mutton and trimmings.</p>
</div>

<p>The name of "ordinary" is most appropriately given to the worthy
Chaplain, who by virtue of his office is present at the ordinary at one,
the other ordinary at five, and again at the two extra-ordinaries
occasioned by the division between the two Sheriffs. It appears that in
the midst of all this superabundance the learned Judges, "huffed" at
having received their invitations from one Sheriff instead of two, have
preferred going dinnerless; wisely, however, hesitating to abandon
themselves to hopeless hunger, they have to compromise with their
dignity by condescending to "lunch" at the table of <span class="smcap">Sheriff
 Wallis</span>.</p>

<p>We confess we should be glad to see the practice of Old Bailey
dinners
getting abandoned altogether, so that the old sarcasm as to "wretches
hanging that Judges may dine," may for ever lose its traditional point,
as it has long ago lost its practical application. There is something
unpleasantly anomalous in the substitution of the table-napkin for the
ermine before quitting the Court, and it is not a pleasant reflection,
that the prisoners having been awarded their deserts, the Judges will,
under the same roof, proceed to take their dinners.</p>

<h4>A French Feast of the Poets.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Beranger</span> the poet is, we are told by the
paragraph-mongers, continually
receiving presents of jam from his enthusiastic countrymen. We regret to
say that our own poets meet with no such sweets, and frequently pass a
life of unmitigated bitters. Instead of presents of jam (now let the
reader prepare to be knocked down by a fearful blow to his common
sense)&#8212;we repeat&#8212;instead of presents of jam our poets too often meet
with a gelid indifference&#8212;<i>jam</i> and <i>gelid</i>; does the reader

we are aiming at?</p>

<p>"Take the English people, strip 'em, rob 'em, kick 'em out of

making of 'em&#8212;even as the Hebrews&#8212;dealers in hare-skins and old
clothes! When this is done, take London, and turn it topsy-turvy,
ruinous like Jerusalem! Let the English House of Commons sit by the
waters of the Danube and weep; and let English Bishops sell maccaroni,
and English merchants vend water-melons to the <i>Lazzaroni</i> of
Naples!
Then Europe will be safe. When the House of Hanover is placed upon a
cinder-heap of Mount Vesuvius, then may Europe, in the depths of her
tranquillity, sweetly rejoice!"</p>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">King of Naples</span> read the foregoing,

<h2>PALMERSTON'S NOTICES TO CORRESPONDENTS.</h2>

<p>Since <span class="smcap">Lord Palmerston</span> said, in his speech
at Perth, that he was always
happy to receive suggestions, and to read the correspondence that
individuals might favour him with, he has been overwhelmed with letters
upon all imaginable and unimaginable subjects. The consequence is he has
been obliged to employ three additional secretaries, who are engaged
night and day answering the stupid questions that are put to him. The
following may be relied upon as a fair sample of the nonsensical
inquiries he is favoured with:&#8212;</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Latakia.</span>&#8212;You are right. There
is no doubt that there is a little
settlement to be found in all Ports&#8212;but this does not apply to the
Sublime Porte; for in spite of all the shaking and stirring it has
lately received, I cannot see the smallest hope of a settlement.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosa Matilda.</span>&#8212;You ask me, my young lady,
what is the best ink for
writing love-letters with? I am sorry I cannot inform you, as it is
now many years ago, in consequence of the graver cares of office,
since I have abandoned the foolish practice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thespis.</span>&#8212;It is more than I can tell you
what kind of <span class="smcap">Brooke</span> has
caused Drury Lane to overflow every night. I have not been to the
theatre this season, and so I cannot inform you whether the <span
class="smcap">Brooke</span>
in question was deep, or merely a shallow <span class="smcap">Brooke</span>,
 or a roaring
<span class="smcap">Brooke</span>, or in fact what particular kind of <span
 class="smcap">Brooke</span> it was; but from
all the reports I have heard, some of which have been very loud, I
should hardly say it was "the murmuring <span class="smcap">Brooke.</span>"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Debrett.</span>&#8212;I cannot tell you <span
class="smcap">Lord Brougham's</span> habitual residence; but,
looking at his trousers, I should say it was generally on the other
side of the Tweed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">One who is fond of Digging for Roots.</span>&#8212;I
should say, from your
foolish question, that the place where you dig most must be a garden
full of simples. How can I say whether "toggery" is derived from the
Latin word <i>toga</i>? Or whether <span class="smcap">Clytemnestra</span>,
 when she was on the
point of stabbing her son, exclaimed "<i>Au Reste</i>?" Or whether a
cross-examination is so called, because it generally has the effect
of making a person "cross?" I wonder you are not ashamed of yourself
putting such insipid questions to one of <span class="smcap">Her
Majesty's</span> Ministers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Public Journalist.</span>&#8212;<span class="smcap">Lord
 Palmerston</span> is extremely sorry he cannot
give the name of the "Old Woman who lived in a shoe," and he doubts
very strongly in his own mind if any old woman ever chose such a
curious locality for a habitation. Perhaps&#8212;and this is merely
thrown out as a conjecture&#8212;it may refer to <span class="smcap">Mrs. Gamp</span>,
 of the
<i>Morning Herald</i>, and who lives in Shoe Lane; but then the song
should run, "There was an old woman, who lived in Shoe Lane," and
unfortunately it doesn't.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horticulturalist.</span>&#8212;The apple of discord was
 doubtlessly, my dear, a
crab-apple; but it is beyond me to say whether <span class="smcap">Venus</span>,
 in accepting
it, was a naughty-culturist; but I can only say, from my own
experience, that it is not the first time by many that Paris has
been the cause of throwing the apple of discord&#8212;witness the Spanish
Marriage.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Et tu Quoque.</span>"&#8212;It would ill become me, in
 my position, to offer
any opinion upon the conduct of a fellow-colleague, so you must
excuse me if I decline answering your inquiry whether <span
class="smcap">Lord Aberdeen</span>
is not "the injudicious bottle-holder of the Porte." I should be
sorry to accept a compliment at the expense of a man whom I so
highly&#8212;but never mind the rest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fiddle-de-dee.</span>&#8212;I will write to <span
class="smcap">Lord Westmoreland</span> at the earliest
opportunity to inquire whether he is composing variations on the
tune of "<i>Pop Goes the Weasel</i>," but I doubt it extremely. Your
other question of whether a man who gives his mind to a violin can
be a clever ambassador, I decline answering.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">That's the Way the Money Goes.</span>"&#8212;You ask
me&#8212;why I don't know&#8212;the
reason why "tin" should be the vulgar synonym for money. It defies
my powers of divination to tell you, unless it originated from the
fact of the purses which are thrown away upon the stage, and which
generally contain from ten thousand ducats to a hundred thousand
pounds, being always filled with pieces of <i>tin</i>. Hence probably
the
synonym.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">One who Dabbles in Ink.</span>&#8212;I do not mind
telling you in confidence
that <span class="smcap">Lord Brougham</span> is <i>not</i> the Editor
of the <i>Family Herald</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Victim to the East Wind.</span>&#8212;The best plan,

<i>daughter of</i> <span class="smcap">Hango Jowdob</span>, <i>wealthy
merchant of Tseen-ki, with a wart
on his nose</i>.</p>
</div>

<p class="salute"><span class="smcap">Moonlight on the Waters of my
Soul</span>,</p>

<p>"Adoring your silver slipper with its buckle of emeralds, profoundly
respecting the gilded toad which lies before your cerulean door in the
light of a scraper, nay, venerating the marble slab that forms the
threshold of the house where lives the angelic daughter of <span
class="smcap">Hango Jowdob</span>
with the wart on his nose, I send you this illuminated rescript. Honour
it.</p>

<p>"Yesterday, O <span class="smcap">Lollum</span>, was a festival among
 these barbarians, and the
Chief Magistrate of their chief city went in procession to swear oaths,
and to bid other judges to devour sea-tortoises with him. A scribe named
<i>Punch</i>, and altogether the wisest and comeliest man I have ever
seen
(excepting <span class="smcap">Hango Jowdob</span>, with the wart on his
 nose, who will probably
read this) gave me a seat in his mansion, which overlooketh the highway.
By <span class="smcap">Con-fu-zee</span>, <span class="smcap">O Lollum</span>,
 but these barbarians have something in them,
after all. Their Chief Magistrate is a vendor of teas, and the array was
got up to remind the spectators of the Flowery Land whence cometh the
fragrant leaf; in short, it was a gorgeous advertisement of his
profession.</p>

<p>"Wisely taking example from the wisest nation of earth, they have
sought
to liken their procession unto what they deem to be Chinese. Poor
savages, they make sad blunders; but our religion teaches us to be
charitable, and to pity rather than ridicule the benighted heathens, who
have not a pagoda in their land, save a miserable one in some gardens
they call Q. Yesterday they exhibited strange mockeries of our Chinese
forms; but still the good will was there, and we will not mock them in
return, but try to teach them better.</p>

<p>"There were shields with faces, as of moons and devils, and
dragon-banners, with bells, and other imitations of us; but the artistic
design and the classical execution were wanting, my <span class="smcap">Lollum</span>.
 The Chief
Magistrate himself rode in a carriage formed like a gigantic tea-pot;
and before and behind him came standards, on which were emblazoned the
prices of his goods. Two huge idols, worshipped by the Fathers of the
City, with costly orgies, were borne along, with Chinese adornments; and
numerous other devices reminded me of the land where dwelleth the lovely
daughter of <span class="smcap">Hango Jowdob</span> with the wart on his
 nose.</p>

<p>"They are all traders, these barbarians, and one of the ancestors of
this Magistrate, whose name is <span class="smcap">Sid-Nee</span>, was a
 great layer of bricks, as
I gather, for he is often spoken of, by public-house orators, as
'<span class="smcap">Sid-Nee</span> on the Scaffold.'</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Lollum</span> of my Soul! Light breaking in at
the Chink of my Heart! Violet
of my Nostrils! Pickled Duck of my Affections! Water-lily floating on
the waves of my Life! Whitest Egg in the Nest of my Brain! I worship
your image, and I kiss the rice-paper which enfolds the eyelash you gave
me at parting. When shall your eyes sparkle into mine, and set all the
fireworks of my soul fizzing, and banging, and sparkling? Eleven
millions of highly polished compliments to the respectable <span
class="smcap">Hango Jowdob</span>
with the wart on his nose.</p>

London.</p>

<h4>PAYING SHOT BEFORE BATTLE.</h4>

<p>The <i>New Prussian Gazette</i> of Berlin says:&#8212;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Several Turkish and Wallachian merchants have arrived
here to pay
their debts. This case several times occurred during the wars of
Turkey with a European power. Turks have come and paid their debts
at the risk of their lives in crossing through the enemy's camp."</p></blockquote>

<p>When this paragraph was read upon 'Change, a melancholy, wan-looking
man
said with a sigh, "I don't wish any harm to Her Catholic Majesty's
Ministers; but I do wish that, if only to relieve us of our bonds,
certain Spaniards would, just for the occasion, become Mahometans."
Certainly <span class="smcap">Narvaez</span> in a fez would create a
sensation in the City.</p>

<hr />

<h2>THE KING OF THE CITY.</h2>

<p>Some new lights have been thrown on the position of the <span
class="smcap">Lord Mayor</span> by
the evidence given before the Corporation Commission which is now
sitting. The <span class="smcap">Lord Mayor</span> seems to be a mixture
 of degradation and
dignity&#8212;a species of civic Centaur&#8212;a kind of neither one thing nor the
other, or rather a sort of both&#8212;a combination of the flunkey and the
potentate, which it would be difficult to analyse. At the Mansion House
dinner he is a Monarch, but at the Coronation banquet he is a Butler, in
virtue of which menial occupation he takes a golden tankard home to
clean, and then claiming it as a perquisite, he never brings it back
again. Why the <span class="smcap">Lord Mayor</span> should appropriate a
 bit of the plate because
he is acting as Butler, is as much a mystery to us, as it would be if
the man we paid to wait when we give a dinner-party were to walk off
with our best piece of plate&#8212;our sugar-tongs, which are real, all the
rest being electro&#8212;under the paltry subterfuge of its being a
"perquisite." We can only say that if the <span class="smcap">Lord Mayor</span>
 were to be stopped
on his way from the Coronation banquet with the golden tankard in his
pocket or under his arm, it would require nothing short of the
production of the original charter, to satisfy the police that he had
lawful possession of the property.</p>

<p>It appears also that the <span class="smcap">Lord Mayor</span> is a
Privy Councillor, but is so
completely cut in that capacity that he is never summoned to attend, and
the probability is, that if his Lordship were to present himself for
admission he would have the door shut in his face by the "proper
officers." It is, however, inconvenient that those dignities should
nominally attach to an individual who is not permitted to use them, and
we can only compliment those who have held the office of <span
class="smcap">Lord Mayor</span>, on
their good sense in not bringing on an unseemly altercation with the
royal porters and door-keepers, by attempting to "get in" when a Privy
Council is sitting. There is no doubt that if "his Lordship" were to
force a passage up into the Council Chamber, and attempt to take his
seat at the Board, there would be a general cry of "turn him out" from
the Cabinet Members. The absurdity of the situation is so apparent, and
the incongruity of the <span class="smcap">Lord Mayor</span> at the
Privy Council is so striking,
that nobody can doubt the propriety of abolishing a nominal position,
which only subjects its holder to ridicule.</p>

<p>The only real power that is still exercised by the <span
class="smcap">Lord Mayor</span> is the
right of shutting up Temple Bar when the Sovereign is expected; but
since the side bar has been rented by a loyal hair-dresser, who would
assuredly let the monarch through his shop&#8212;if any serious obstacle were
to be offered by the civic authorities&#8212;it is high time that even this
dim branch of the civic prerogative were lopped off by the axe of
Improvement, that judicious woodsman, who spares nothing superfluous.</p>

<hr />

<h4>"REVENONS À NOS MOUTONS."</h4>

<p>The French, in a great victory over the Arabs, "have captured 4,000
sheep." What will they do with these 4,000 prisoners of war? Will they
drive them to market, and sell them for what they will fetch, or will
they turn them into <i>gigots</i> and <i>cotelettes?</i> Will they
preserve their
fleeces as trophies, and hang them up in the Invalides? What will they
do with the tallow? Will they melt it into candles, and send them as
altar-offerings to the <span class="smcap">Pope</span> to solicit his
blessing on their Algerian
campaigns? These questions are difficult to answer, and in the meantime
the poor sheep, recollecting the deeds of <span class="smcap">Bugeaud</span>
 and <span class="smcap">Pélissier</span>, must
tremble in their skins every time they see the steel of the Frenchmen.
For ourselves, we believe the lives of the 4,000 sheep will be spared by
the French, out of their noble anxiety to prove to Europe that warfare
can be carried on in Algeria without butchery.</p>

<hr />

<h4>Mute Eloquence.</h4>

<p>Somebody has brought out a collection of the "<i>Songs of Scotland
without
Words</i>." In order to render the thing completely agreeable, we would
propose that the songs without words should be set to bagpipes without
sound, and sung by performers without voices.</p>

<h2>THE DEMON OF THE CUPBOARD.</h2>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 60%;">
<a href="images/190.png">
<img src="images/190.png" alt="THE DEMON OF THE CUPBOARD"
width="100%" /></a>
</div>

<p>Within the last few months mysterious noises have been repeatedly
heard
in the cupboards of <span class="smcap">Her Majesty's</span> subjects
throughout the kingdom. These
have been, in most instances, at first supposed to be occasioned by mice
and rats, as they consisted in scrapings, scratchings, and knockings,
such as are made by those animals. But in many cases wherein the noises
were the most violent, cheese contained in the cupboard was found
untouched; so that it was necessary to seek some other explanations of
the acoustic phenomena.</p>

<p>The circumstances of table rapping obviously suggested that the
sounds
were caused by spirits; and several powerful mediums were consulted,
independently, with respect to this point. The answers to all inquiries
obtained through these channels agreed in the fact that the cupboards
were haunted; and also coincided in the further information that the
name of their obstreperous inhabitant was <span class="smcap">Nicholas</span>.</p>

<p>This startling declaration apparently rendered the character of the
author of the disturbances no longer doubtful, and was considered by
serious clergymen a conclusive proof that they resulted from "Satanic
Agency."</p>

<p>However, to subsequent interrogatories, as to whether the "<span
class="smcap">Nicholas</span>" who
scratched in the cupboards was the same as that personage generally
known as "Old Scratch," the reply was uniformly in the negative; and the
cupboard-haunting <span class="smcap">Nicholas</span> was described as
not that old one but "the
other."</p>

<p>Several defunct <span class="smcap">Nicholases</span> were then
named, and the question was put
with regard to each in succession, whether he was the one alluded to;
but in every case it was declared that the individual mentioned was not
the scratching <span class="smcap">Nicholas</span>.</p>

<p>At last&#8212;in a kind of jocose despair&#8212;was put the inquiry, whether the
<span class="smcap">Nicholas</span> was the <span class="smcap">Emperor
of Russia</span>. When, to the amazement of all the
hearers, the response distinctly rapped out was "Yes!"</p>

<p>A clue was thus obtained for ulterior investigation, by which it was
elicited that the <span class="smcap">Czar Nicholas</span> was in the
cupboards by force of his
operation on the loaf, of which, by his nefarious proceedings, prompted
by ambition, pride, and rapacity, he had raised the price to everybody
in the nation. The knocking and scratching indicated rage and fury,
combined with irritation and vexation on account of having got into a
scrape.</p>

<p>The sort of ubiquity which seems involved in one individual vermin
infesting so many cupboards at the same time, is declared to be a
mystery, the solution of which is referred to the abstruser laws of
mesmerism. By the assistance of the mediums we learn that <span
class="smcap">Nicholas</span> has
remarkable faculties of a spiritual kind, which he partakes of as the
limb participates in the nature of the parent body. Hence, indeed, he is
adored as the deity of the Russians; just as his ancient namesake is
"honoured for his burning throne."</p>

<p>Since the above particulars were communicated, it has been positively
averred, by ladies venerable for their years and other persons of the
soundest judgment as well as the highest respectability, that, on going
to their cupboards late at night to cut a slice of bread and butter,
they have been terrified by the miniature apparition of a gigantic
figure with an inflated aspect, bestriding the loaf in a military
uniform and a pair of jack-boots. So that now, in almost all families,
when any strange noise is heard about the house, it is customary to
refer the disturbance to the <span class="smcap">Czar</span> in the
cupboard.</p>

<hr />

<h2>A BISHOP ON "THINGS SOLID."</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The Bishop of Oxford and Oil-cum-Honey</span>
made a beautiful speech at the
Mansion House in favour of the <span class="smcap">Albert</span>
Memorial. Never did tongue talk
more silverly for bronze. Nevertheless, there is a passage in the
episcopal harangue&#8212;(let us not forget to observe, it is reported of the
Bishop that in his guilelessness he is wholly unaware of the road from
Oxford to Lambeth)&#8212;a passage relating to "things solid" that somewhat
puzzles us. <span class="smcap">Samuel of Oxford</span> observed (and <span
 class="smcap">Mr. Samuel Carter Hall</span>, who,
he said, "represented the artists," smiled and applauded the words)
that&#8212;</p>

<blockquote><p>"It is of the very nature of <i>things solid</i> that,
instead of being
borne along upon the surface of the stream of time, <i>they sink
gradually down</i> beneath its waters; and, therefore, with regard to
this great fact&#8212;and <i>a great fact</i> I hold it to have been&#8212;if any
memorial is to be raised at all, I think it should be raised while
yet the memory of its greatness holds its true place in the
impression of those by whom it was witnessed."</p></blockquote>

<p>Because, if <span class="smcap">Prince Albert</span> has not a
monument in bronze to remind the
short memory of human nature that there was once a Crystal Palace in
Hyde Park, the recollection of that great fact, being a "thing solid,"
will gradually sink down into the waters of oblivion. Just as,
doubtless, we should have forgotten Waterloo and its results, if certain
ladies of England had not set up a statue of <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>
 acting <span class="smcap">Achilles</span>
in Hyde Park. Well, we have a notion that the best and most enduring
monument to the memory of the fleeting Crystal Palace in the Park will
be provided by the enduring glory, even at the present time, crowning
Sydenham Hill.</p>

<p>We have the greatest admiration of the intellectual subtleties of the
<span class="smcap">Bishop of Oxford</span>. Like an olive, his nature
secretes its own oil.
Nevertheless, we should have liked to hear other bishops upon "things
solid." Where was the <span class="smcap">Bishop of London</span>? Is it
 possible that any
churchman can speak upon better authority, from deeper experience of
"things solid," than the teacher of Fulham? Why, then, was the chief
power of illustrations of the "solids" of this life merely required of
<span class="smcap">Samuel of Oxon</span>? Moreover, <span class="smcap">Prince
 Albert</span> is, it seems, to have the
statue: and among the alto-reliefs will, doubtless, be <span
class="smcap">Challis</span> reading
his patent of baronetcy.</p>

<p>The thing is decided upon. So gentlemen, unbutton your pockets; and
down
with the pounds&#8212;the "things solid," if we mistake not, <span
class="smcap">Bishop of
Oxford</span>.</p>

<h4>TWO PORTRAITS OF THE CZAR.</h4>

<p>In the well-known <i>Letters from the Baltic</i>, <span class="smcap">Nicholas</span>
 is thus drawn in
pen and ink&#8212;</p>

<blockquote><p>"His face is strictly Grecian&#8212;forehead and nose is one
grand line;
the eyes finely lined, large, open, and blue, with a calmness, a
coldness, a freezing dignity, which can equally quell an
insurrection, daunt an assassin, or paralyse a petitioner: the mouth
regular, teeth fine, chin prominent, with dark moustache and small
whisker; but not a sympathy in his face. His mouth sometimes smiled,
his eyes never."</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Mr. Punch</i>, having studied the Czar in his works, is disposed
to put
forth another sketch; as thus&#8212;</p>

<p>His face is strictly all cheek: forehead and nose one grand
roundabout
curve; the eyes large, open, round, and expressive as a cannon's mouth;
cannon that can quell an insurrection, or slaughter innocence; the mouth
curved and significant as a scimitar; teeth large and prominent as
chevaux-de-frise; the face altogether a national death-warrant. The
mouth, like scimitar steel, sometimes glistens&#8212;the eyes never.</p>

<hr />

<h4>Mutual Wrongs.</h4>

<p>"We have no Windsor"&#8212;says, very mournfully, the <span class="smcap">Earl
 of Eglington</span>&#8212;"no
Buckingham Palace, no St. James's, no Kensington, no Hampton Court."</p>

<p><i>Mr. Punch</i> begs to mingle his tears with the tears of the noble
 Earl,
<i>Mr. Punch</i> the while lamenting as an Englishman that&#8212;"We have no
cockaleekie&#8212;no haggis&#8212;no singed sheep's-head&#8212;no bagpipes!"</p>

<hr />

<h4>Grumbling for Farmers.</h4>

<p>The late fine weather has enabled us to get the wheat into the
ground,
which the previous rains threatened to prevent. Agricultural prospects
thus present a hopeful appearance; but then, by reason of the extent of
land sown, a great many fields must be in a state of seediness.</p>

<h2>CHEAP LIGHTNING-POSTAGE.</h2>

<p>The formation of a New General Electric Telegraph Company is
contemplated by <i>Mr. Punch</i>.</p>

<p>To supersede and cut out all existing Electric Telegraph Companies
will
be the object of the New General Electric Telegraph Company, of which
<i>Mr. Punch</i> meditates the establishment.</p>

<p>Nothing can be clearer to the reflecting mind than that a shock of
electricity is, of itself, one of the cheapest commodities that can be
produced.</p>

<p>Nothing is more notorious than the fact that an electric shock,
imparted
to the wire of an Electric Telegraph, is about as dear an article as any
in the market.</p>

<p>The extent of the circuit traversed by a shock of electricity does
not
add to its cost. The messenger incurs no travelling expenses.</p>

<p>Yet nine shillings is the sum which "A Poor Man in Trouble," who
wished
to inquire respecting a sick relative, complains to the <i>Times</i>
that he
was asked to pay for the simple message "Is he better?" with answer, to
be transmitted from a station 46 miles from town to the neighbourhood of
Belgrave Road, Pimlico.</p>

<p>If there is any one speculation peculiarly calculated to pay on the
principle of large sales at low prices, it is manifestly an Electric
Telegraph.</p>

<p>In preference, therefore, to any Austrian or Spanish loan, in which
enterprising parties may be disposed to risk their capital, <i>Mr. Punch</i>
invites them to join him with their two or three millions in his
proposed New Electric Telegraph Company; unless the present Companies,
awakened by the fear of competition with <i>Punch &amp; Co.</i>, should
reduce
their prices immediately.</p>

<h2>JUSTICE FOR LONDON.</h2>

<p>One of the features in the <span class="smcap">Lord Mayor's</span>
Show of the other day was a
figure of "<span class="smcap">Justice</span>, in a Car drawn by Six
Horses." Singularly enough,
the six horses showed a disposition to pull different ways, and the
leaders on each side were as obstinate in trying to upset <span
class="smcap">Justice</span> as a
couple of Old Bailey barristers. It was rather a bold measure to
introduce Justice officially into any part of the proceedings on <span
class="smcap">Lord
Mayor's</span> Day, for if the goddess were present among the
Corporation in
reality rather than in effigy, the probability is, that there would be
no procession on <span class="smcap">Lord Mayor's</span> Day, in
consequence of there being no <span class="smcap">Lord
Mayor</span>, as a natural result of there being no Aldermen from whom
to
select the potentate.</p>

<p>It might have been remarked the other day, that the civic idea of
Justice differs from all the ordinary notions of the character, for the
<span class="smcap">Justice</span> of the Corporation of London as seen
in the procession, instead
of being blindfold, wore a bandage over the forehead in such a way as
not to interfere with her sight, or prevent her from having both her
eyes open to her own interest. Her scales were rather gigantic, but she
did not carry them in her hand, and they seemed to be emblematical of
nothing but the balance she keeps hung up, as it were, without being
accounted for. Poor <span class="smcap">Justice</span> seemed to be
frightfully shaken by the
treatment she experienced in the City; and, after the fatigues of the

<h2>KING LEOPOLD REPORTS PROGRESS.</h2>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/194.png" alt="T" class="cap" width="25%" />

<p class="cap_2">THE <span class="smcap">King of the Belgians</span>
opened his Chambers last week, and it is to be
regretted that <span class="smcap">King Leopold's</span> excellent
speech has been so incorrectly
translated by the London newspapers. No wonder that <span class="smcap">Lord
 Clarendon</span>
complains of the inadequate way in which the journalists render his
despatches. An English dramatic author, hurried in his rapine, could
hardly have adapted a French speech more clumsily than it has been done
for our papers. We subjoin a literal translation:</p>
</div>

<p>
"<span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>,<br />
</p>

<p>"I am charmed to meet you again. When we separated, you were so kind
as
to express your entire satisfaction with the marriage I told you I had
then in view for my son, the <span class="smcap">Duke of Brabant</span>.
 I need not inform you that
the match has since come off, because I do not suppose you will easily
forget the portentous (<i>effroyable</i>) disturbance we made about it.
But
you will be happy to hear that I have taken Mary <span class="smcap">Henrietta
 of Austria</span>
and her husband over to England, and that our charming friend and
relative <span class="smcap">Queen Victoria</span> was quite pleased
with the bride, and considers
<span class="smcap">Brabant</span> a fortunate young fellow.</p>

<p>"It is, I hope, unnecessary for me to say that it was not merely, or
chiefly, to introduce a young wife to a young matron that I endured the
perilous voyage from Ostend to Portsmouth. You will do your King more
justice.</p>

<p>"Allied with the House of Austria, I found in that marriage the
strongest reason why my voice should be heard in England at a
conjuncture (<i>crise</i>) when Austria needed an advocate there. But
this is
not all. You know how long and how sedulously I have laboured to get the
<span class="smcap">Emperor Nicholas</span> to accredit an ambassador
from Russia to Belgium. His
Majesty has, for years, disdained my request with Northern haughtiness
(<i>fierté</i>), but, either for reasons of mine or his own, he has at
last
accorded the favour. Since that boon, it is well known to you that
Russia has had only to ask and to have in Belgium. I was therefore
doubly bound to undertake my English mission, charged as I was with the
interests of Austria and of Russia.</p>

<p>"That the Prince Consort of England and myself retired into the
shooting
field together&#8212;for the Sovereign of England has a certain
straightforwardness (<i>droiture</i>) which makes it difficult to urge
diplomatic considerations in her hearing&#8212;you may have learned. If I
alluded to the danger which might accrue to Saxe Gotha in the event of
Russia, Austria, and Prussia not regarding its princes as their friends,
I am sure the august sportsman to whom I addressed such a speculation
will not have listened to me in vain. The friends of <span class="smcap">Mary
 Henrietta</span> and
of our newly-arrived ambassador have no reason to be dissatisfied with
the effect I produced.</p>

<p>"I may therefore felicitate you, Gentlemen, and myself, on the
perfect
concord which exists between Russia, Austria, Saxe Gotha, and Belgium,
and I am glad to add that the aged and accomplished prime minister of
England, the good <span class="smcap">Aberdeen</span>, fully concurs in
the sentiments of those
four powers.</p>

<p>"Details of your own finance and other topics affecting yourselves
will
be supplied by my Ministers, but I could not refrain from personally
informing you of the quadruple alliance which I, and our charming <span
class="smcap">Mary
Henrietta</span>, have done so much to cement, and which I trust you
will
remember should we ask for any little addition to the estimates.</p>

<p>"That the blessing of, &amp;c."</p>

<hr />

<h4>THE "GOD OF RUSSIA."</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Nicholas</span> is the acknowledged deity of the
Muscovites. A god standing six
feet four in his sacred stockings. The manner in which he recruits his
army to carry on his Holy Wars is very celestial. Sometimes he causes
his angelic Cossacks to surround a boys' school and carry off the
scholars, promoting them from the birch to the knout. In one particular
case two boys, one 12 and the other 14, were carried away, their old
grandmother of 85 raising her hands, doubtless in prayer for the God of
Russia. Who can doubt the Christianity of an Emperor, who is at once the
heart and soul of such a system? Poor fellow! In his last proclamation
he says "He has been goaded into war by the <span class="smcap">Porte</span>."
 Goaded is the word.
Only think of the nasty red-wattled turkey gobbling at and goading a
poor, harmless, innocent bear! We shall next have the Christian dove
pecking out the eyes of the twin-headed eagle.</p>

<hr />

<h2>THE INNKEEPER RHYMER.</h2>

<p>Now that every British Innkeeper clearly holds himself privileged to
take as many people in continually as his house will hold, it has become
a question of quite national importance how most effectually to check
their chousing. In our position of Adviser-General to the Nation, we
have of course been nationally consulted in the matter, and we therefore
feel called upon to give our readers&#8212;we mean of course the nation&#8212;our
opinion on the subject.</p>

<p>It being generally admitted, by everybody but themselves, that the
present system of our Innkeepers has become, like a baby, quite a crying
nuisance, we think it may most properly be dealt with in the cradle: and
we would therefore have our rising generation early prepared for the
fleecing that awaits them. We are sure that by judicious treatment a
wholesome horror of hotels might be easily impressed upon the infant
mind. We would have the landlord take the place of the infantine "Old
Bogy," and figure in our fairytales as the terrible old Ogre, who lives
upon the unsuspecting travellers who come to him: while in all the
juvenile editions of our Natural History he might be represented as a
species, only known in England, of the <i>Ornithorynchus</i>, or <i>Beast
 with
a Bill</i>. Instead of the deeds of mythic "Forty Thieves," our
nursemaids
should recount the rogueries of an inn; and, instead of threatening a
"dark room" by way of penal settlement for the fractious, they in future
might condemn them to a "private" one at an hotel, lit with nominal wax
candles at half-a-crown an inch. "<i>Reform your Landlord's Bills</i>"
should
be, of course, an early round-hand copy, and the first thing in the
spelling-book a spell against extortion. In short, no means should be
spared to represent an hotel as a sort of inhumane mantrap, which it is
impossible to get out of without considerable bleeding.</p>

<p>The same wholesome warning might be given through the medium of those
senseless lyrics which are known to us, collectively, as our Nursery
Rhymes. We have long had a contempt for these unmeaning
<i>Humpty-Dumptys</i>, and have long considered them a national
disgrace.
They were an insult to our cradlehood, and are still continually an
annoyance to our maturer ears. The proverbial wisdom of our ancestors is
but little shown, we think, in having handed them down to us. It is
humiliating to think that in this era of enlightenment, this present
March&#8212;or, we should rather say, November&#8212;of Intellect, such nonsense
can be tolerated. Any well-regulated baby must, we are persuaded, feel
itself disgraced by it.</p>

<p>In the position we hold as national benefactors, we have long been
anxious to reform these truly "nonsense verses," and we are resolved
that when our stereotyped "want of space" no longer afflicts us, we will
"seriously incline" our pen to an attempt at their amendment. Meanwhile,
upon a subject so suggestive as the present, we can't resist throwing a
little reason in the rhymes; and we feel we shall be doing the infant
state some service by printing, as a specimen, our <i>Innkeeper Rhymer</i>.</p>

<h2>THE ALBERT STATUE MOVEMENT.</h2>

<p>A meeting of the principal metropolitan Statues took place yesterday
morning at Exeter Hall. Time was when such an assemblage would have been
looked upon as rather an extraordinary event; but recent manifestations
have prepared the public mind for the phenomena of statue moving and
statue talking: and this convention of sculptures created more interest
than astonishment. The object of its attendants was to take into
consideration the proposal for the increase of their number by the
addition thereto of a monument to His Royal Highness <span class="smcap">Prince
 Albert</span>.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Statue of Fergus Mac Ivor</span>&#8212;from the
shop-front of <span class="smcap">Mr. Sanderson</span>,
tobacconist&#8212;having been voted into the chair, stated the purpose of the
gathering. Of course the costume of the <span class="smcap">Prince's</span>
 statue would be
determined with reference to the associations of Balmoral; and he should
hail the introduction of the illustrious new member to the clan. The
only question was, where to place the Statue? For his part he should
have much pleasure in affording it a site by vacating his own post at
the door, and retiring into the shop.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Statue of George the Third</span> would
willingly resign to the new comer a
position which was painfully conspicuous, and withdraw into an obscurity
where a pigtail would cease to attract perpetual derision.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Statue of George the Fourth</span>, equally
with the effigy of his Royal
Parent, would be glad to abdicate in favour of the Statue of the <span
class="smcap">Prince
Consort</span>. He was nervously sensible of constituting, together with
 his
quadruped, something very unlike one of the Elgin Marbles. It would
delight him to dismount, and let the <span class="smcap">Prince</span>
get up instead.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">King Charles the First's Statue</span> at Charing
 Cross said, perhaps the taste
of the Committee would determine that His <span class="smcap">Royal
Highness</span> should get up
behind.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Duke of York's Statue</span> felt that there
were peculiar reasons why, if
any site were relinquished in favour of the intended testimonial, it
should be his own. The country owed something, anyhow, to <span
class="smcap">Prince Albert</span>;
but whatever <span class="smcap">Prince Albert</span> owed the country,
he paid his debts, and his
representative would not be exposed to continual banter on that score.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Statue</span> of the <span class="smcap">Great
 Duke</span>, from <span class="smcap">Burton's</span> Arch, said that
he had the
honour to represent <span class="smcap">Field-Marshal the Duke of
Wellington</span>. <span class="smcap">Field-Marshal
the Duke of Wellington</span> had been awarded by the country a Statue
during
his life. The same tribute was about to be paid to <span class="smcap">Field-Marshal
 Prince
Albert</span>. The Statue of <span class="smcap">Field-Marshal the Duke</span>
 had nothing to say to any
estimate the country might think fit to form of the comparative
necessity for a Statue of <span class="smcap">Field-Marshal the Prince</span>.
 But that point being
settled, the proper place for the Statue would be parallel to his (the
Statue of the <span class="smcap">Duke's</span>) own. His own was the
top of the arch on one side
of the road, and <span class="smcap">Prince Albert's</span> might be
that of the gateway on the
other.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nelson's Statue</span> considered that the
suggestion of the Statue of the
Noble <span class="smcap">Duke</span> was founded on the notion that the
 monument to <span class="smcap">Prince Albert</span>
was intended to commemorate the Great Exhibition. In that case the
gateway at Hyde Park Corner certainly would be the fittest place for it;
near enough to the scene of the triumph, and alongside of the memorial
to the Hero of Waterloo. But, to speak straightforwardly, the fact was,
that the scheme of a Statue to the <span class="smcap">Prince</span> was
 a device of the
Corporation of London to ingratiate themselves at Court. The Statue was
meant to be a propitiatory concern&#8212;to conciliate the protection of
Royalty for the City&#8212;and the proper situation for it would be over
Temple Bar, to serve as a Palladium to that edifice and the interests
therewith connected.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gog</span> and <span class="smcap">Magog</span>,
rising together, loudly expressed their approbation of
this view; the adoption of which would tend to secure themselves in
their own places, which they wished to retain as long as they were able,
like all others holding comfortable situations in Guildhall.</p>

<p>A motion embodying the concurrence of the meeting in the opinion that
the Statue of <span class="smcap">Prince Albert</span> should surmount
Temple Bar was then put and
carried unanimously, when, after the usual vote of thanks, the meeting
broke up, and the molten and graven images departed to their respective
sites.</p>

<hr />

<h4>Sheriffs' Officers Superseded.</h4>

<p>We hear that an ingenious mechanic at Ipswich has invented a machine
to
perform perpetual motion, which is described as "self-acting after being
put in motion by a screw." So is a bailiff who acts on a usurer's writ.

<h2>CLOWNS OF THE NEW SCHOOL.</h2>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/196a.png" alt="S" class="cap" width="10%" />

<p class="cap_2">SOMEBODY said that it takes a wise man to make a fool.
This stands to
reason, like the parallel proposition, that it takes a man to make a
beast of himself; for if anybody is rendered either beast or fool by his
own act, he cannot have been either the one or the other previously.
But, running counter to the proverb, fools now endeavour to make wise
men, and the Clown on the stage combines the teacher with the tumbler;
is didactic and funny; intermingles philosophy with antics, and
moralizes and makes faces by turns. The play-going public may perhaps
admire this conjunction of light and shade with motley; if so, its taste
will be catered for by enterprising managers. In the preparation of the
Pantomimes for Christmas, the Clowns should be got to rehearse their
parts carefully, with a view to the correct delivery of those discourses
which will constitute the serious portion of their business. When the
Clown throws off his great head, and his regal vestments, or doublet and
trunk hose, and rushes to the foot-lights, he utters an exclamation and
propounds an interrogatory. Tradition requires thus much; but Fashion
will demand more. He will have to expand and amplify the old forms of
words whose brevity has hitherto been sufficiently instructive as well
as amusing, so as to elucidate the fulness of their significance. For
example:&#8212;Having been transformed from Emperor to Zany, <span
class="smcap">Mr. Merryman</span>, at
the tap of the Fairy's wand, jumps out of his robes, and appears in his
diversified and proper colours. He turns his toes in, and runs up to one
of the stage boxes. He there stoops forwards, resting his hands on his
knees, grins, squints, rolls his eyes, thrusts his tongue out, and
pulling himself by the ears, draws it back again. He then composes his
flake-white and vermilion countenance, and utters the following
soliloquy:&#8212;</p>
</div>

<blockquote><p>"On this spot of earth, at this moment of time, between
the past and
the future, that is to say, <span class="smcap">Here</span>, an
aggregation of human entities,
animal creatures endowed with reason and conscience, a multitude of
Objects that constitute You in relation to the One Individual
Subject, Myself: in a word, <span class="smcap">We</span>, exist in a
state of conscious Being,
of self-cognisant perceptivity and ratiocinativity; in short, <span
class="smcap">Are</span>!</p>

<p>"In what condition, mental or bodily, of suffering or enjoyment, of
weal or woe, of riches or poverty, of health or disease, of
seriousness or levity, of gravity or mirth, of appetite or satiety,
of wakefulness or somnolence, more briefly, How, in respect to the
state of conscious being, self-cognisant perceptivity and
ratiocinativity, exist, or <span class="smcap">Are</span>, that
multitude of Objects which in
relation to my Individual Selfhood, constitute <span class="smcap">You</span>?</p>

<p>"To condense my meaning into the fewest words by which it is capable
of being confined, I would remark that,</p>

<p>"Here We Are!</p>

<p>"And to that momentous observation, allow me to add the profound
inquiry,</p>

<p>"How Are You?"</p></blockquote>

<p>So saying, the Clown flings a summerset, and proceeds to pick
pockets,
swallow sausages, and burn himself with the hot poker, varying these
practical pleasantries with dissertations on morals and metaphysics.</p>

<h2>THE POST OFFICE LONDON DIRECTORY FOR 1854.</h2>

<p>We have perused this volume with considerable pleasure. We observe
that
it contains two thousand four hundred and ten pages, most of them
comprising three columns of closely printed matter, and but that we
found it impossible to take the book up, we have no doubt we should have
found it equally impossible to lay it down. As a literary composition it
is really remarkable, for the tone which the author takes up at the
beginning is preserved to the very end, and the same unflaggingness, if
we may be permitted the word, which on page 1 introduces us, with a
<span class="smcap">Palmerstonian</span> jauntiness, to <span
class="smcap">Mr. Abbott's</span> coffee-house in the
Whitechapel Road, conducts us, with a <span class="smcap">Gladstonian</span>
 tenacity of purpose,
to <span class="smcap">Mr. William Young</span>, the accidental
secretary of deaths, on page 2288.
But do not let us be misunderstood. There is no monotony of treatment.
We are successively presented with a series of <i>tableaux</i>, or
rather
tables, of life, of a perpetually varying character. We first find "our
warmest welcome at an inn," and Green Dragons, Blue Lions, Essex
Serpents, and White Horses, spit, roar, hiss, and neigh before us in all
the frightful friendliness of provincial hospitality. Then we are shown
official circles, and there is no mistaking the individual who is
delineated, whether he lounges and reads the <i>Morning Post</i> in the
Treasury, sternly overhauls the national ledger in the Audit Office, or
waits upon the tides, or overhauls the travelling baskets of returning
young ladies, near the Custom House Stairs. Anon, the mysteries of the
streets of London are laid open to us with a minuteness which neither
<span class="smcap">Asmodeus</span> nor <span class="smcap">Mr. Peter
Cunningham</span> has ever attempted. But our author is
not confined to the <i>trottoir</i>; trades&#8212;whose followers look
jealously
on the census-paper, and by no means affectionately on the income-tax
return&#8212;are thrown open, and to him everybody reveals his business
instead of telling the prying writer to go about his own. He equally
shines in his portraiture of political life, and not a senator,
hereditary or accidental, spiritual or temporal, escapes his eye. The
next time <span class="smcap">Lord Naas</span> has to hunt for <span
class="smcap">Mr. Keogh</span>, he may be spared the
scandal of airing himself eleven times, in vain, upon the mosaics of the
Reform Club; and the next time the nation is looking out for a Premier,
it need not, for lack of an address, select <span class="smcap">Lord
Aberdeen</span> instead of
<i>Mr. Punch</i>. The voluble actuary of the assurance office, the
drab-breeched and white-haired banker, the smart stockbroker and the
smarting stockjobber, the parchment-visaged chamber-counsel, and the
bold-eyed champion at the Old Bailey, the dowager of Mayfair, the
guardsman of the club, the virtuous and self-denying author in his
<span class="smcap">Andrew Marvel</span> chambers, the post-office
clerk, and all the men of
letters (ha! ha!) of St. Martin's-le-Grand, the sour bachelor of the
Albany, and the gentle Benedick of St. John's Wood, and the other
myriads who help to make London, from <span class="smcap">Her Gracious
Majesty</span> down to&#8212;no,
<i>Punch</i> is merciful&#8212;are all designated here. In short, inapplicable
 as
is the word to the biggest as well as the best book of our acquaintance,
the Post Office Directory not only contains all that we want to know,
but precise information as to at least a couple of millions of people
whom&#8212;except as readers, in which capacity they exist already&#8212;we
sincerely hope that we never shall know.</p>

<p>The following extract gives a good idea of the author's style:&#8212;</p>

<p>Already, reform has been felt in Guildhall. At the <span

dinner, the eighty waiters employed to change plates and pour out for
the Corporation had, every one of them, a whole half-pint of beer! This
allowance was pre-arranged by way of test, and for future guidance. One
Alderman is worth, at least, four waiters. Hence, at all future
banquets, every Alderman will have allowed him a whole quart of beer,
and beer of the bitterest into the bargain.</p>

<h2>COBDEN ON EVIL SPIRITS.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Cobden</span> has written another of those
pithy letters on great
principles that&#8212;some day&#8212;will make a very charming little volume of
<i>Cobdeniana</i>. He is solicited to give his opinion on the best mode
of
"Opening the trade in spirits?"</p>

<p>"The best way," replies sagacious <span class="smcap">Richard</span>,
 "of dealing with the monopoly
of spirits is to abstain from drinking them, which for upwards of twenty
years I have done."&#8212;Spirits make felons, lunatics, and suicides, says
<span class="smcap">Mr. Cobden</span>. Hence, the Bottle might surmount
Newgate and Bedlam. <span class="smcap">Mr.
Cobden</span> does not drink spirits; but, moderately, he drinks
wine&#8212;wine
that cheereth the heart of man? Will he, then, do his best that the
masses of his countrymen may take a glass with him? The wine-growers of
France want to sell us pure, cheap, healthy wine&#8212;wine that would soon
destroy burning gin, inflammatory brandy. France needs iron, England
claret. Will <span class="smcap">Mr. Cobden</span>, if only as an
apostle of peace, help us, that
we may exchange British metal for Gallic grape? We should like to drive
the English "pig" into the French vineyard.</p>

<h2>IMAGINARY CONVERSATION.</h2>

<center>(<i>Without the least foundation.</i>)</center>

<p><i>Mr. Punch.</i> <span class="smcap">Captain Leicester Vernon</span>,
 you will be good enough to answer
a few questions.</p>

<p><i>The Captain.</i> Sir, I shall be happy to do so.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Punch.</i> You are, <span class="smcap">Captain</span>, I
believe, the adapter of the drama
called <i>The Lancers</i>, performing at <span class="smcap">Mr. Charles
 Kean's</span> theatre?</p>

<p><i>The Captain.</i> I am.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Punch.</i> You are also the member for Chatham?</p>

<p><i>The Captain.</i> I am.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Punch.</i> You intend to take your seat in the next
Parliament, and do
your duty by your constituents and the nation?</p>

<p><i>The Captain.</i> Such is my desire.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Punch.</i> And the aspiration does you credit. Some very
important
questions will come before the Legislature during the approaching
Session.</p>

<p><i>The Captain.</i> Ah! They always say that&#8212;always.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Punch.</i> And rightly, Sir. But in the next Session we are
promised
measures whose importance is indisputable. In the first place, <span
class="smcap">Captain</span>,
there is the Reform Bill. To vote rightly&#8212;I will not say speak
sensibly&#8212;upon its clauses, some information is necessary to a member of
Parliament. Favour me with a sketch of the history of popular
representation, of the principles on which you consider it should be
based, and of the arguments for and against extension of the suffrage.</p>

<p><i>The Captain.</i> Really&#8212;a&#8212;a&#8212;</p>

<p><i>Mr. Punch.</i> Ah! You have not studied the subject. Well. We are
to have
a measure for the better distribution of the revenues of the Church of
England. Pray what is the amount of those revenues, and upon what tenure
are they held?</p>

<p><i>The Captain.</i> Amount. Tenure. Really&#8212;a&#8212;a&#8212;</p>

<p><i>Mr. Punch.</i> Ah! you have not studied the subject. <i>Non omma
possumus
omnes.</i> Well&#8212;we are to have a revision of the criminal law. What do
you
consider the principal defects of the present system, and what remedies
would you adopt with regard to old, as distinct from juvenile offenders?</p>

<p><i>The Captain.</i> Distinction. Come&#8212;well&#8212;why&#8212;a&#8212;if&#8212;that is&#8212;a&#8212;</p>

<p><i>Mr. Punch.</i> Ah! You have not studied the subject. Well. The
question of
Colonial Administration is to be raised, and the comparative advantages
of central and of local self-government will be discussed. Will you
sketch the working of each system in our colonies, distinguishing those
to which constitutions have been granted, and will you point out the
defects of both the existing systems?</p>

<p><i>The Captain.</i> Why&#8212;a&#8212;if you come to foreign parts&#8212;why&#8212;a&#8212;</p>

<p><i>Mr. Punch.</i> Ah! You have not studied the subject. Well. We
shall have
to consider a most important topic, partly legal, partly social; I mean
the doctrine of partnership, and of limited liability, on the wise
treatment of which depends the welfare of myriads of our population.
What is your theory of partnership?</p>

<p><i>The Captain.</i> Really&#8212;as to topics of that head&#8212;a&#8212;a&#8212;</p>

<p><i>Mr. Punch.</i> Ah! You have not studied the subject. Then, Sir,
with every
one of the great questions of the next Parliament unstudied by you, why
do I find you wasting your time in translating French plays for <span
class="smcap">Mr.
Charles Kean</span>. Is <i>he</i> getting up your Parliamentary
information for
<i>you</i>? (<span class="smcap">The Captain</span> <i>bursts into tears</i>.)
 There, there&#8212;I only gave you
a hint, and there are three months to the meeting of Parliament. If you
distinguish yourself there, I shall have nothing to say to <i>The
Lancers</i>; but if not&#8212;</p>

<h2>COURTESY AND CONTROVERSY.</h2>

<p>In a kindly and reasonable letter to the <i>Times</i>, the <span
class="smcap">Rev. J. M. Capes</span>,
a Roman Catholic clergyman, recommends controversialists, both those of
his own creed, and Protestants, to conduct their discussions with
moderation and decency. This excellent advice, we are sure, will be
followed by all disputants of either sect who are arguing for truth. <span
 class="smcap">Dr.
Cumming</span> approves of it. So doubtless will <span class="smcap">Dr.
 Newman</span>. Nay, perhaps one,
or two, or even three more, on each side, will adopt the judicious and
amiable suggestion of <span class="smcap">Mr. Capes</span>.</p>

<p>But as the object of the great majority of polemics is not truth but
triumph, the probability is that they will not confine themselves to
unadorned logic, but like a sort of candidates at the theological
hustings, will continue to bandy aspersions, as heretofore, and cover
one another with all the ridicule they can, each with the view of
bringing his adversary into contempt and odium with the British Public.</p>

<p>Moreover, there is a stake at issue&#8212;no offence either to Rome or
Geneva; liberty of thought, speech, and writing; freedom, political and
social. The question is, whether Britons shall be subjugated to a
priesthood and a foreign power&#8212;and not only that, but whether, by
receiving the religion of Rome, we may not engage ourselves to accept
the institutions of Naples. Which question it is not likely that Britons
will discuss dispassionately; and moderation may be inculcated to those
who are at issue upon it with about as much hope as gentleness and
forbearance may be preached to the belligerents in Moldo-Wallachia.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Capes</span> complains of "a certain class of
 objects" of Roman Catholic
faith and affection being "made the subjects of scorn, ridicule, and
reviling." Very bad taste this on the part of Protestant buffoons. But
since, if the objects alluded to are worthy of reverence, any insult
that may be offered to them can hurt nobody but the scoffer, surely such
bad taste ought not to annoy <span class="smcap">Mr. Capes</span>
further than by exciting in his
mind a painful anxiety for the fate of those who are guilty of it.</p>

<p>Let <span class="smcap">Mr. Capes</span> consider what manner of
persons those are who are vexed by
having their persuasions derided. They are not those who believe that
two and two make four; no, but those who believe that two and two make
something else. They are those who believe what <span class="smcap">Mr.
Capes</span> believes; and
those who believe themselves to be Kings or Deities.</p>

<p>Alluding to a particular tenet, which to Protestants appears contrary
 to
common sense, <span class="smcap">Mr. Capes</span> says&#8212;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Let not such a doctrine be made the subject for jesting, scoffing,
contemptuous sneers, or those still more revolting attempts at
convincing us that we are fools, which the followers of Exeter Hall
occasionally adopt."</p></blockquote>

<p>It seems strange that the attempt to convince <span class="smcap">Mr.
 Capes</span> that he is a
fool should be still more revolting to him than the derision of what he
esteems most holy. But, not to dwell on this point, how, we may ask, if
a dogma is absurd, is it possible to convince a man that it is so
without at the same time convincing him that he is a fool for believing
it? To use a rather West British form of speech, we are sure that any
wise man who differs from <span class="smcap">Mr. Capes</span> would be
much obliged to that
reverend gentleman for proving to him that, in respect of that
difference, he was a fool.</p>

<h2>THE CITY INQUISITION.</h2>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/199.png" alt="A" class="cap" width="43%" />

<p class="cap_3">AMONG the numerous points which have struck <i>Mr.
Punch</i> in perusing the
evidence taken before the invaluable Commission which is daily forging
the hatchet destined to hew down that rotten old tree the Corporation,
and scatter its owls and bats, is the remarkably miscellaneous character
of the information with which the witnesses favour the Commissioners.
Any gentleman who is passing and chooses to step in, is politely asked
by the Chairman whether he happens to know anything about the City; to
which, with equal off-handedness, he replies, "Well, yes," or "Well,
no," as the case may be, and then his evidence is taken. While <i>Mr.
Punch</i> was waiting to make <span class="smcap">Sheriff Wallis</span>
happy by telling him that he
approved of that Sheriff's conduct in refusing to contribute to the
<span class="smcap">Sidney</span> Spectacle, he heard something of this
kind.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Montmorenci Jones</span>: Do I know much
about the City? Well, no, not
much, but I shall be happy to tell you anything that occurs to me. I
have to go to the City sometimes on money matters. Live there? No, I
should think not. Who lives there but porters, junior partners, and
warehouse cats? I live in Regent Street. But I don't despise the City. I
think there are some good points about it. The things in the shops are
much better than the West End things&#8212;and so far cheaper, but as to
actual price it's about the same. You're cheated in the City because
ground is so dear, and at the West End because the tradesmen must pay
for those gaudy, gilded, ginshop-looking fronts. But the City men are
sharper, and insist on a better article&#8212;<i>we</i> believe anything a
tradesmen tells us. If you will cleanse away the <span class="smcap">Lord
 Mayors</span> and Fleet
Ditches, and a few things of that kind; keep out those <span
class="smcap">Pickford's</span> vans
and other monster abominations, so that one's cab may not be smashed
every time one passes through Temple Bar; widen the thoroughfares, and
prevent people from dining at one o'clock, so that one smells dinner
before one has well finished breakfast&#8212;I think that the welfare of the
City would be materially promoted. I may mention, too, that I have seen
some very pretty girls in St. Paul's Churchyard, and not so badly
dressed as you might expect, but the poor things get jostled so
dreadfully by the City fellows, who rush about like <span class="smcap">Jeameses</span>
 on an
errand, that they always look frightened. I think the Police, that make
the cabs go slowly past churches, might be told to keep these fellows at
a decent walk when going near ladies. Take a note of that suggestion for
your Report.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Suffeet De Peristyle</span>: I am an
architect. O, yes. I have taken much
interest in the City; and sometimes, while shaving, I have mentally
sketched out plans for improving it. Will I state any? With pleasure;
and as my principal plan has relation to the Corporation, it is the more
desirable for you to hear it. I am for dealing boldly with the City. Let
us begin at Temple Bar, which I would not remove. Take down the whole of
the houses on both sides of Fleet Street and Ludgate Hill, and clear the
space to the Thames. Embank the Thames. On the left side of Fleet
Street, erect a splendid series of halls, cloisters, and habitations,
reaching from Temple Bar to St. Paul's. Throw King's College, the London
University, Merchant Tailor's, the Blue Coat School, and the
Charterhouse into these, and re-endow them, and pay all expenses by
confiscating the Corporation estates, and, if necessary, the private
property of the Aldermen. Let the right hand side of Fleet Street be a
beautiful meadow, with fountains and statues, to the Thames. Preserve
<i>Mr. Punch's</i>, of course, but rebuild it in alabaster, and make it
the
feature of the scene. Take down St. Paul's and re-construct it in white
marble, which will wash, and clear away in its rear an area of a quarter
of a mile, to be paved with mosaic.&#8212;(<i>The Commission, fairly aghast
and
out of breath, cause the witness to be removed.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Grubb</span>: I keep the accounts in a City
house, as my father did before
me, and I hope my son will after me. I do not desire to see any
alteration in the Corporation, in the City, or anywhere. I was very
happy on my tall black stool for forty years, and now they've pulled a
house down in their precious improvements, and the sun falls right in my
eyes, and I have been obliged to move the desk at which my father took
his seat in 1789. Time of the French Revolution? I dare say it was; I
don't take much heed of politics, especially since <span class="smcap">Billy
 Pitt</span>. You've
nobody like him now. I saw his funeral in Feberwerry, 1806&#8212;yes, I saw
that last year, but it was not equal to <span class="smcap">Billy Pitt's</span>.
 If you'll take my
advice you'll let well alone; but of course you won't. I don't know what
the world's coming to&#8212;the youngsters in our house are taking to
moustarshiars, and a young radical of sixteen declares he can't exist
without his shower-bath. Little enough such brats washed themselves in
my times&#8212;a dip in the New River once a month, or so, satisfied them,
and somehow we managed Trafalgar and Waterloo without your boards of
health, and missionaries in sewers, or whatever you call them. Once
more, I say, let well alone.</p>

<h2>POSTAL ECONOMY AT GLASGOW.</h2>

<p>Scotchmen are famous for their economical disposition. Here is a
remarkable instance of Scotch economy:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
<center>"LETTER CARRIERS&#8212;AN APPEAL.<br /><br />

"<i>To the Editor of the Glasgow Herald.</i></center>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&#8212;We feel, with you, indignant at
 the scurvy treatment we
have received at the hands of the London authorities, in reference
to our Post Office, and think we ought to take the matter in the
meantime in our own hands, so far as concerns the <i>Carriers</i>.</p>

<p>"We all confess they are badly paid, and a highly deserving class of
public servants. We therefore propose to all the merchants in this
district to co-operate with us and form a committee, to give a
practical expression to our feelings for the men, by raising a fund
to give them at least 4<i>s.</i> per week extra to their present low
salaries, and a suit of comfortable uniform.</p>

<p>"We calculate that a very small weekly sum from a tenth part of the
merchants here would place the men for one year in a comfortable
position, and be the means more fully of calling public attention
and indignation to the subject.</p>

<p>"If the above scheme succeeds in this district, it might be extended
to others.</p>

<p>"We shall be glad to receive communications on this proposal, and
shall consider ourselves richly paid for any trouble we have taken
in the matter, if it be the means of placing the <i>Letter Carriers</i>
in comparative comfort.</p>

<p class="regards">"We are, dear Sir, yours very truly,</p>

<p class="author">"<span class="smcap">Wilson &amp; Matheson</span>, 58,
 Candleriggs."</p></blockquote>

<p>It is much cheaper for a merchant to contribute a small weekly sum
towards giving his letter carrier a proper salary, than it is to be out
of pocket through having letters of importance, some containing
remittances, mislaid or stolen, because the man is not paid enough to
induce a competent and honest person to undertake the situation.</p>

<p>This example of Scotch prudence, therefore, is one that deserves to
be
followed by the generous commercial public, indeed by the public at
large, of England: if <span class="smcap">Her Majesty's</span> upper
servants at Downing Street
cannot be induced to allot a fair proportion of wages to <span
class="smcap">Her Majesty's</span>
under servants in connexion with St. Martin's-le-Grand.</p>

<p>But it would really be almost a saving if the Government were to give
the postmen a reasonable hire. When <span class="smcap">Mercury</span>
the messenger turns <span class="smcap">Mercury</span>
the thief, and, tempted by want, steals half-a-sovereign, marked by <span
 class="smcap">Mr.
Sculthorpe</span>, out of the letter he is intrusted with, getting
himself, by
that act, into the dock at the Assizes, and thence into penal servitude,
he costs the country, from first to last, more than would have sufficed
to maintain several honest <span class="smcap">Mercuries</span> during
the same time in blue and
scarlet and respectability.</p>

<p>That the proposal, alike judicious and handsome, for making up for
Government's stinginess to the letter carriers by private liberality,
should have emanated from <span class="smcap">Messrs. Wilson and
Matheson</span> of Glasgow, is a
fact that adds a feather to the cap of Scotland, and if acted upon by
their countrymen, will render it impossible any longer to withhold the
position on the Royal Standard, which is claimed by that sagacious and
noble animal the Scottish Lion.</p>

<hr />

<h4>The Post-Office Directory.</h4>

<p>The companion volume to the above elegant publication is the "<i>Almanach
des
 25,000 Addresses</i>," published at Paris. We do not know who is the
Editor of that interesting volume, in which may be found some of the
greatest names in French literature and science, but we should say that
no one would be better qualified for the task than the <span
class="smcap">British Drama</span>, as
no one, as our stage can testify, can possibly be acquainted with a
greater number of <i>French cribs</i>.</p>

<hr />

<h4>THE CZAR'S ITERATION.</h4>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Emperor of Russia's</span> lying manifesto
concludes with a quotation from
a Psalm. This is only fresh proof that old <span class="smcap">Nicholas</span>
 can quote Scripture
for his purpose.</p>

<h2>CURE FOR SMOKY CHILDREN</h2>

<p class="salute">"<span class="smcap">My dear Mr. Punch</span>,</p>

<p>"My son <span class="smcap">Henry</span>&#8212;who promised to be such a
good young man&#8212;has, I am sorry
to say, acquired that <i>nasty dirty</i> habit of smoking tobacco, in
which
he indulges from morning till night: such a pity at his time of life!
for he is not of age yet. In the <i>Times</i> the other day I saw a
letter
about the Smoke Nuisance, proposing to cure it by 'very frequent feeding
in small quantities, and a reward for no smoke.' Do you think, now, it
would be possible to break <span class="smcap">Henry</span> of smoking
by continually tempting him
with little bits of something very nice to eat?&#8212;the worst of it is that
filthy practice has quite spoiled his taste for cake and tart. Reward
for no smoke I have offered in vain. I should be <i>so</i> much obliged
to
you, <i>Mr. Punch</i>, if you <i>could</i> suggest any plan by which I
could
manage to wean my child from his cigars by frequent feeding in small
quantities; indeed, indeed, it would be quite a charity to</p>

<p class="author">"<span class="smcap">A Mother</span>."</p>

<p>&#8258;The frequent feeding in small quantities might, in all
probability, be accomplished easily enough. An occasional kidney&#8212;if
devilled, so much the better; a broiled bone now and then; from time to
time a sausage; an anchovy toast after dessert: later in the evening,
perhaps, a poached egg, a Welsh rabbit, or a few scalloped oysters:
these and similar delicacies substituted for pastry, would most likely
very much simplify the difficulty of getting <span class="smcap">Henry</span>
 to take small
quantities of food at short intervals. But experience unfortunately
proves that such a system of diet is not generally accompanied, on the
part of young men, by a discontinuance of smoking; whilst it is almost
always attended with an excessive consumption of malt liquor.&#8212;<i>Punch.</i></p>

<h2>PLAIN FARE AT THE PALACE.</h2>

<p>The <i>Court Circular</i> informed us the other day that "there was
no
addition to the Royal dinner yesterday." We should not have had the
impertinence to speculate on the bill of fare at the Palace, had we not
been, as it were, invited to the subject by the Court Newsman, who tells
us that there was "no addition to the Royal dinner." We can only
compliment those who have the arrangement of the Palace provisions on
their frugality, which in these days of dear provisions is a virtue that
all housekeepers would do well to imitate.</p>

<p>If there was "no addition to the Royal dinner," it is clear that the
Royal Family must, on the day in question, have been eating cold&#8212;or at
most hashed&#8212;the "joint" of the day previous. We confess we do not like
the idea of the younger branches being deprived of any of those little
luxuries so dear to juvenile as well as to "other lips and other
hearts;" and, therefore, in the event of any future announcement of "no
addition to the Royal dinner," we should be glad to read the extra
intimation "<i>but</i> there was a pudding in the nursery."</p>

<hr />

<h4>The Price of Coals Accounted for.</h4>

<p>It is usual with small tradesmen to increase the weight of coals by
sprinkling cold water upon them; but in the City the reason why coals
come so heavy is owing to the <i>City dews</i> falling upon them for
twenty
miles round London. When these dews are collected, it is found that the
difference, which, of course, weighs upon the price, amounts, in the
course of the year, to many hundred thousands of pounds!</p>

<hr />

<h4>WHERE ARE THE RUSSIANS?</h4>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/201b.png" alt="W" class="cap" width="40%" />

<p class="cap_3">WHAT has become of the Russians, of whom 80,000 were
said to have passed
the Pruth, while 24,000 is the greatest number that has been yet
accounted for. People are beginning to suspect that the Russian Army in
the Principalities is like the Russian Army at <span class="smcap">Astley's</span>
 having a
considerable force behind some imaginary hills, and running round and
round by the back of the stage to give an appearance of numbers. We all
know that theatrical population progresses more rapidly than any other
kind of population; and if our census shows that we double ourselves in
fourteen years, a dramatic census will show that a theatrical
population&#8212;if well marshalled by the stage manager&#8212;will double itself
in less than five minutes. These considerations, however, do not help us
in our difficulty, when we ask what has become of some 40,000 or 50,000
Russians that are wholly unaccounted for? We may be told in the usual
loose phraseology of the chronology of war that they have been "cut to
pieces." But before we can believe this dreadful assertion, we have a
right to demand the production of at least the "bits" into which the
Russians have either been smashed, chopped or beaten. Perhaps the most
plausible way of accounting for the slaughter of the thousands of
Russians whose remains are nowhere to be found is by the very natural
supposition that they were but giants of the imagination, manufactured
before they were slain by some literary <span class="smcap">Tom Thumb</span>,
 who is "doing the
foreign correspondence" of some London journal in his lodgings at
Lambeth.</p>
</div>

<hr />

<h4>A Cup Too Much.</h4>

<p>We understand that <span class="smcap">Prince Albert</span> has
nothing whatever to do with the
movement got up by the (late) <span class="smcap">Lord Mayor</span>, and
 indeed <span class="smcap">His Royal Highness</span>
has as much distaste for the baneful cup of adulation as he has for "the
poisoned <span class="smcap">Challis</span>."</p>

<hr />

<h4>AN ALARMING DISCOVERY.</h4>

<p>Somebody is advertising every day an instrument warranted to
"frighten
but not kill" the public in general. The terrific instrument is no less
than a Gong, which for 40 shillings will frighten a thief, will "appal a
burglar" for 60 shillings, and for the comparatively small matter of
four pounds will "alarm the country." We hope the Government will at
once put a prohibitory duty on these gongs, for it will be an awful
state of things if anybody may have it in his power to frighten the isle
from its propriety for eighty shillings. Unless something is immediately
done to check the danger that threatens us, there is no doubt that "Bang
goes the Gong" will become as great a nuisance as "Pop goes the Weasel."</p>

<hr />

<h4>Turtle in Ecstasies.</h4>

<p>Accounts from Honduras represent the turtle in the Bay as exhibiting
symptoms of extraordinary excitement; flapping their fins, paddling
about with unwonted rapidity, lifting themselves on end and dancing and
jumping out of the water; in short, realising the most vivid idea of
lively turtle. These symptoms of hilarity among the furnishers of green
fat have been referred to the anticipation of the extinction of the City
of London Corporation, and consequent discontinuance of the <span
class="smcap">Lord Mayor's</span>
dinners.</p>

<hr />

<h4>THE GORTSCHAKOFF JACKET.</h4>

<p>The uniform of <span class="smcap">Prince Gortschakoff</span> has not
 been described. We believe
the principal article of it is a "cut-away."</p>

<hr />

<h4>Protection for the Sloe.</h4>

<p>Everybody is for reducing the duty on French wines, except certain
wine-merchants. As importers, the interests of those gentlemen could
hardly be affected by the reduction; but perhaps they do not look on
port and import as exactly the same thing.</p>

<h2>REMARKABLE TRIBUTE OF SIDEREAL APPROBATION TO MR. HIND.</h2>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/203.png" alt="O" class="cap" width="40%" />

<p class="cap_3">OUR old Friend <span class="smcap">Mr. Hind</span>
having introduced another new planet (the ninth
discovered by him) to the notice of mortals, the announcement was
received by all the sidereal bodies with the greatest satisfaction, and
indeed so greatly increased the perturbations under which some of them
habitually labour, that <span class="smcap">Zadkiel</span> has been
compelled to publish a
supplement to his Almanack, and to predict the arrival of the Greek
kalends, the destruction of the Thames by fire, and, simultaneously with
these events, the extinction of <i>Punch</i>. <span class="smcap">Saturn</span>,
 in particular, who
considers that the calumnious report of his having devoured his own
children had its origin in our ignorance of the existence of those
children, as a group of asteroids between <span class="smcap">Mars</span>
 and <span class="smcap">Jupiter</span>, and who is
consequently delighted whenever by the discovery of such asteroids his
character is cleared, was so overcome with joy, that no child born
during the past week will ever be injured in after life by this
generally malignant planet.</p>
</div>

<p>Many of the stars, moreover, feeling that something was due to <span
class="smcap">Mr. Hind</span>
for his persevering efforts on their behalf, resolved to call a public
meeting to consider the best means of expressing their gratitude. The
<span class="smcap">Pleiades</span>, as occupying the centre of the
universe, kindly offered their
rooms for the purpose; and <span class="smcap">Merope</span>, whose
marriage with a mortal caused
her to lose half her brightness, and brought upon her frequent snubbings
from her sisters, brightened up again on perceiving that her haughty
relatives were disposed to patronise one of her husband's race. The
meeting was numerously attended, but excuses were received from some of
the more distant stars, who alleged that if they travelled at the rate
of 12,000,000 of miles per minute they could not arrive until 4,000
years after the meeting had broken up. The <span class="smcap">Great
Bear</span> pleaded illness as
an excuse for non-attendance; and it was whispered that mortification at
the ill success of <span class="smcap">Prince Gortschakoff</span> had
brought on a fit of the gout.
Many of the <span class="smcap">Nebulæ</span> arrived from a great
distance, and were accommodated
with seats in the Strangers Gallery; but we regretted to observe that
their uncouth forms laid them open to the silly remarks of <span
class="smcap">Capricorn</span>,
who certainly cannot boast of his own personal attractions, and of
<span class="smcap">Jupiter's</span> satellites, who, though they are
bound to amuse their master,
should have known better than to insult foreigners. In the Reporters'
Gallery the <span class="smcap">Gemini</span> attended for the <i>Herald</i>
 and <i>Standard</i>, but could
only muster one pen between them; <span class="smcap">Taurus</span>
appeared for the Conservative
weeklies, and <span class="smcap">Sirius</span> (<span class="smcap">Toby</span>
 is <i>en rapport</i> with Sirius, and always howls
when he sees him,) kindly undertook to report for <i>Punch</i>.</p>

<p>After an absurd attempt on the part of a clique to thrust the sun of
our
system into the chair, <span class="smcap">Alcyone</span>, who is at
present the centre of gravity
round which the whole universe revolves, was selected for that important
office, and immediately called upon "her excellent friend <span
class="smcap">Mercury</span>," for
the first and only resolution. The <i>facundus nepos</i> <span
class="smcap">Atlantis</span> thus
adjured, in a speech replete with eloquence, moved, "That this meeting,
viewing with extreme displeasure the practice of associating the newly
discovered sidereal bodies with the names of persons who have had no
share in the discovery, proposes to call the nine planets, discovered by
<span class="smcap">Mr. Hind</span>, by the common name of <span
class="smcap">Hind's</span> Night Lights, as a small mark of
the grateful feelings entertained for that astronomer throughout the
sidereal system." This resolution, having been briefly seconded by
<span class="smcap">Aldebaran</span>, was put and carried unanimously;
and, after the customary
vote of thanks to <span class="smcap">Alcyone</span>, the stars returned
 to their orbits; but not
until the nine planets aforesaid, who, dressed in white, had been seated
in a row on the platform, had induced <span class="smcap">Pollux</span>
to take round a castor, and
make a collection for their support. We ought also to state that the
well-known <span class="smcap">Music of the Spheres</span> was in
attendance, and gave great
satisfaction by its performance of "<i>Vaga Luna</i>," "<i>Oft in the
Stilly
Night</i>," "<i>Rise Gentle Moon</i>," and other airs set for "Voices of
 the
Night." When <span class="smcap">Mercury</span> alluded to the
disappearance of two stars from the
constellations&#8212;<span class="smcap">Hercules</span> and <span
class="smcap">Lyra</span>&#8212;these celestial voices sang "<i>The
Light of Other Days</i>" with much taste. Indeed, the taste for singing
which <span class="smcap">Shakspere</span> ascribed to the stars is in
no way diminished, for the
whole meeting, on breaking up, joined very nicely in</p>

<h2>A GREAT ANCHOVY CASE.</h2>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Burgess and Son</span>," whose name will go down
 to posterity in a
cruet-stand, have lately been throwing their fish-sauce into Chancery,
and an equity judge has been discussing the essence of anchovies with a
<i>gusto</i> quite remarkable. The barristers engaged in the matter have
doubtless verified the fact, that little fish are sweet, for the
anchovies have of course yielded some pretty little fees to pretty
little juniors. <span class="smcap">Messrs. Campbell</span> and <span
class="smcap">Moore</span> were on one side, while <span class="smcap">Mr.
Bacon</span> and <span class="smcap">Mr. Nelson</span> represented the
anchovies on the other side, and
counsel pushed about the anchovy bottle from the Court below to the
Court above, with a determination to bring the sauce of Burgess to the
very fountain of equity. The great anchovy case has been already before
the Vice Chancellor and the Lords Justices, but whether the parties will
carry their "sauce" up to the Lords is at present dependent probably on
how they may be "advised" by learned counsel to go on expending money in
litigation, or "if not why not," or "how otherwise."</p>

to have very properly rescued his daughter (a silly young lady who left
her own for a "Servant's Home") from the clutches of the Papist

families. The magistrate seems to have doubted his power, but could he
not have dealt with the reverend revivalists as Boddy-snatchers? Surely

<h2>DIDDLESEX SESSIONS.</h2>

<p>(<i>Before</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. Serjeant Eves</span>, <i>Assistant-Judge</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joseph Gubbins</span>, <i>alias</i> <span
class="smcap">Crabb</span>, <i>alias</i> <span class="smcap">Bloomfield</span>,
 <i>alias</i> the
<i>Grinner</i>, was charged with stealing a pewter pot, value one
shilling,
from the rails of a house in Millbank Street. <span class="smcap">Mr.
Slasher</span> prosecuted,
and <span class="smcap">Mr. Crasher</span> defended the prisoner. The
case was distinctly proved.</p>

<p><i>The Judge.</i> Now, <span class="smcap">Joe</span>, have you
anything to say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Crasher</span> objected to the prisoner being
 addressed as <span class="smcap">Joe</span>. He firmly
believed, upon his sacred honour, that such a misdescription vitiated
the whole proceedings. At all events he called on the Judge to take a
note of the point.</p>

<p><i>The Judge.</i> I shan't. Stuff and nonsense. The objection is not worth
twopence.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Crasher.</i> It's worth fourpence at least, but it is quite in keeping
with all that goes on here that a Judge should not know the value of a
Joe.</p>

<p><i>The Judge.</i> That's slang, and though a Counsel ought to be slangy, a
Judge ought not.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Crasher.</i> I am quite prepared to hear the independence of
the Bar
assailed, and the freedom of speech, which every authority from
<span class="smcap">Heliogabalus</span> down to <span class="smcap">Blackstone</span>
 declares the right of an advocate,
stigmatized as slang. But it will not prevent my doing my duty.</p>

<p><i>The Judge.</i> Do your duty. Who stops you? Do your duty. Who's
<span class="smcap">Heliogabalus</span>, and what's <span class="smcap">Heliogabalus</span>
 to do with <span class="smcap">Joseph Gubbins</span>? This is
the way the time of the Court is wasted.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Crasher.</i> As the Court concedes the point, and calls the
prisoner
by his name, I shall not pursue the argument.</p>

<p><i>The Judge.</i> You may do as you like.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Crasher.</i> I know I may.</p>

<p><i>The Judge.</i> I'm glad you know it.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Crasher.</i> I'm glad you are pleased.</p>

<p><i>The Judge.</i> Very well.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Crasher.</i> Very well.</p>

<p><i>The Judge.</i> <span class="smcap">Joseph Gubbins</span>, you have
 been very properly found guilty of
stealing a pot&#8212;I mean you will be in a moment&#8212;eh gentlemen? (<i>Jury
nod.</i>) Of course. You have been found guilty of stealing a pot. Now
pot-stealing is a crime which is injurious to the public weal&#8212;-</p>

<p><i>Mr. Slasher.</i> And public-house.</p>

<p><i>The Judge.</i> Ha! ha! very good. I laugh, you see, <span
class="smcap">Mr. Crasher</span>, to show
that I am undisturbed in my temper.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Crasher.</i> I have no objection, Sir, to your laughing at my
learned
friend, in fact I do so myself ten times a day.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Slasher.</i> "All fools have still an itching to deride."</p>

<p><i>Mr. Crasher.</i> If the Court stands that, of course I can.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Slasher.</i> The Court is sitting.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Crasher.</i> Is it?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Slasher.</i> Of course it is.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Crasher.</i> Ah!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Slasher.</i> Ah too, if you come to that.</p>

<p>[<i>The Judge joins in the repartees, which are protracted so long
that</i>
<span class="smcap">Mr. Gubbins</span> <i>takes off his shoe, and swears
 that unless his sentence is
passed he will "shy it" (to use his objectionable expression) "at the

<h2>THE PRICE OF A LORD MAYOR'S GOWN.</h2>

<p>Every "family man" will appreciate the annoyance of being called on
frequently for "a new gown;" but the most expensive milliner's bill
would be a mere song&#8212;to a moderate tune&#8212;compared with the cost of a
"new gown" for the <span class="smcap">Lord Mayor of London</span>. In
the evidence before the City
Corporation Commission we find it stated by <span class="smcap">Mr.
Acland</span>, that</p>

<blockquote><p>"There is an amount of seven guineas paid for a violet
gown for the
<span class="smcap">Lord Mayor</span>. In another instance there is an
item of £17 for the <span class="smcap">Lord
Mayor's</span> silk violet gown. On the occasion of the <span
class="smcap">Duke of
Wellington's</span> funeral, there is a sum of £72 for the <span
class="smcap">Lord Mayor's</span>
silk gown."</p></blockquote>

<p>We cannot pretend to understand either the necessity for such an
extensive stock of gowns as the <span class="smcap">Lord Mayor</span>
seems to possess, or for such
a frightful fluctuation in the price of one and the same article. We
know of no system of arithmetic or rule of three by which we are to get
a solution of the question: "If a <span class="smcap">Lord Mayor's</span>
 gown cost £7 at one time,
and £17 at another time, why is it to cost £72 at a subsequent period?"
We can only say that <i>as</i> £7 <i>is not to</i> £17, <i>so cannot be</i>
 £72 by any
rule or principle whatever.</p>

<p>Some very pleasing horsemanship at Drury Lane is being marred by some
very obnoxious assmanship on the part of sundry clowns engaged, we
suppose, for the purpose of marking the contrast between the stupidity
of bipeds, and the sagacity of quadrupeds. We have no objection to the
old Astleyan Clown, who is continually wanting to know what he shall "go
for to fetch for to bring for to carry," but we must protest against the
modern school of buffoons who, under the ambitious title of "<span
class="smcap">Shaksperian</span>
jesters," or some other pseudonyme, inflict their dull platitudes on an
impatient audience. Directly a clown becomes too fat to tumble, or too
stupid to play the fool in the ordinary way, he adopts the name of
"<span class="smcap">Shaksperian</span>" and bores the public with long
lectures, which he fancies
may be received as instructive, because they happen to be the very
opposite of entertaining&#8212;- just as if a man ceasing to be an amusing
fool must of necessity become a philosopher.</p>

<p>The "clown to the ring" is, in fact, becoming a perfect nuisance: and
 we
only wonder that the horses do not become low-spirited by contrast with
those dreadfully dull dogs who wear the motley. It would be quite
refreshing to meet with a good old conventional clown of former times,
who would not be above asking <span class="smcap">Widdicomb</span> "if
his (<span class="smcap">Widdicomb's</span>) mother is
aware of his (<span class="smcap">Widdicomb's</span>) absence from
home;" or making any other of
those rare old imbecile remarks which used to set us in a roar in our
days of infancy. A philosophic clown to the ring is, in fact, an
anomaly; for every one admits the idle absurdity of "Reasoning in a
Circle."</p>

<h2>AN ALBANY FOR THE MILLION.</h2>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/205.png" alt="T" class="cap" width="40%" />

<p class="cap_3">TO the health of towns, moral and physical, it is
universally agreed,
that one indispensable condition is the abolition of Slums. But then
what is to become of the Slummites? The low neighborhoods may be done
away with, but there is no doing away with the low neighbours; who
cannot be disposed of by fire and water and poison, along with the bugs
and rats and other vermin that run upon four, or more, legs. Besides, in
spite of all appearances to the contrary, it is certain that they are
human beings; so that we cannot, consistently either with Christianity
or common law, get rid of them exactly as if they were black beetles.
And if routed out of their courts and alleys, they will crawl or lie
about the streets, or, making themselves still more unpleasant, die
under our noses.</p>
</div>

<p>It therefore becomes necessary to provide them with proper abodes.
Suburban kennels and pigsties will not do, as it is necessary that they
should reside near enough to their work. Model Lodging Houses,
therefore, well supplied with water, and arranged in all other respects
with reference to the prevention of effluvia, have been suggested
instead, as intramural habitations for the inferior classes. To these
the only objection is their name.</p>

<p>The gentlemen who inhabit a certain double row of buildings
contiguous
to and parallel with the Burlington Arcade would be, most of them,
disgusted, if those edifices were spoken of as Model Lodging Houses.</p>

<p>But there is good reason to believe that not only have the lower
classes
the same number of members&#8212;in an anatomical if not in a parliamentary
sense&#8212;as the higher, but that they are really endowed with essentially
even the same passions and feelings. Among other sentiments it has been
ascertained that they possess those of pride and vanity, which are not
only exasperated by scorn and contumely&#8212;as when they are called the
scum of the earth, the riff-raff, and the rabble&#8212;but also by
contemptuous patronage: by all sorts of badges, whether metallic or
verbal. There is something of the latter sort of badge in the term
"Model Lodging Houses." The expression is low; suggests an invidious
distinction of caste: a state of degradation descending almost to
pauperism.</p>

<p>To meet this objection it is proposed to erect a building containing
little suites of small apartments, adapted to the requirements and
circumstances of the poorer portion of the people, to be called "The
Industrious Albany;" industrious for the sake of distinction; or, if a
more explanatory title shall be preferred, "Cheap Chambers." Ventilation
and Warmth combined with Comfort and Cleanliness are to preside over the
interior arrangements, and the external proportions are to be regulated
by architectural taste, whilst the rent will be fixed at the most
economical figure. Investments of capital in this promising speculation,
to any amount, may be paid into the Office, 85, Fleet Street.</p>

<h2>"THE UPHOLSTERER TO THE MONUMENT."</h2>

<p>We see, in the reports of the City Commission, that there is a
situation
with the above singular title. We wonder, in the name of everything
that's wonderful, what are the duties of this curious functionary? What
is there to hang, excepting the birdcage with the dingy canary,
belonging to the porter, at the entrance door? There may be a few
play-bills, also, and some steamboat placards; does "the Upholsterer" go
every morning to hang these outside the railings? What is the furniture
that is inside the Monument? and where is it stowed away? Or is the
"Upholsterer" engaged to keep the flutes of the columns clean? Or is it
his particular duty to rub up the Panorama of London that is viewed from
its summit? There is no other picture that we are acquainted with,
belonging to the Monument, excepting the picture of London's busy
traffic across London Bridge, and surely this is a picture beyond the
"Upholsterer's" reach? One would imagine from the fact of the Monument
having an "Upholsterer," that there were chairs, tables, four-post
bedsteads, curtains, and a regular houseful of furniture locked up
inside it. We shall pay a visit to the Monument the first fine day there
is no fog, and bring away with us an inventory of the furniture. In the
meantime, we should like to be informed of the amount of salary of this
"Upholsterer," who has to look after a place that contains no
Upholstery.</p>

<h2>PERSPICUITY OF RED TAPE.</h2>

<p>In reply to a request for information where to get the Blue Books
which
are granted to Mechanics' Institutions, "<span class="smcap">A
Provincial Secretary</span>,"
writing to the <i>Times</i>, says that he received the following
official
directions; that is to say, he was told</p>

<blockquote><p>"To make application at the proper season to the clerk of
 the
committee, to be appointed pursuant to the report of the House of
Commons on Parliamentary papers, ordered to be printed on the 7th of
July last."</p></blockquote>

<p>This the "<span class="smcap">Provincial Secretary</span>" wants
translated for the benefit of
himself and other country gentlemen. The passage may be construed
thus:&#8212;</p>

<p>At certain times of the year, and between certain hours, which will
be
appointed hereafter but are not fixed yet, apply to somebody who will
perhaps be the clerk of a committee which does not at present exist but
will, one of these days, in conformity with a report of the House of
Commons on Parliamentary Papers, which was ordered to be printed on the
7th of July last, be constituted, if that report shall ever be acted on.</p>

<p>The translation is rather longer than the original; but if brevity is
required to be the soul of official advice, the answer might simply have
been "Arrangements have not been made," to which, if any further
explanation were necessary, might have been added, "And when they will
be, Heaven only knows."</p>

<h2>THE DIGNITY OF TRADE.</h2>

<p>We were going to say that the fact of a noble Lord having passed the
Bankruptcy Court the other day as a horse-dealer, gives strong
confirmation to the saying that we are a nation of shop-keepers. But
perhaps a horse-bazaar or repository cannot be properly called a shop;
and though the horse may be taken over a bar, that noble animal cannot
very well be handed across a counter; thus, whatever leaps the noble
lord in question may have taken, it is clear that it would be incorrect
to call him a counter-jumper. His case, however, certainly tends to show
that we are a highly mercantile community, since it exhibits a member of
one of our principal families as a dealer in horseflesh. But the fact
is, that business is practised by the aristocracy in general to a very
considerable extent. Not only do some of them trade in boroughs, but
also in rabbits, together with hares, pheasants, and partridges,
inasmuch as they sell game. They are not ashamed of this, either: for
they will converse about shooting, and not one of them ever calls on the
other to sink the shop. Indeed, to sink the shop would be to sink the
Island, and swamp the whole concern conducted by <span class="smcap">Aberdeen</span>
 and <span class="smcap">Co.</span></p>

<p>At a time when certain parties are raising the price of their Ales,
which were previously sold at rates considerably higher than such as
would have been fairly remunerative, the Public, and especially
pedestrian travellers, will be interested to learn that a light and
wholesome <span class="smcap">Beer</span> may be obtained upon the
lowest possible terms, as it
will be delivered to all applicants at the mere cost of a visit to the
<span class="smcap">Depôt</span>, Porter's Lodge, <span class="smcap">St.
 Cross Hospital</span>. This <span class="smcap">Superior Beverage</span>
 is
brewed from pure Malt and Hops, according to a Hom&oelig;opathic
Improvement on the original Receipt handed down from the ancient Masters
of <span class="smcap">St. Cross</span>, and is produced in such high
perfection by the present
Master, the <span class="smcap">Earl of Guildford</span>, that while the
 smallest quantity will
suffice the most inveterate toper, the largest might be imbibed
conscientiously by the strictest votary of Total Abstinence. The
remarkably low charge for which this Ale is offered to the consumer is
owing to the liberality of the Founders and Benefactors of the
Institution; who bequeathed capital to a large amount on trust for the
gratuitous supply of the genuine article to wayfarers. In Horns of
Half-a-Pint each, at the rate of One Measure per Diem. To be Drunk on

<h2>THE BAR AND THE LIBERTY OF THE SUBJECT.</h2>

<p>A few days ago a case was called on in one of the "Superior" Courts,
when an application was made to put it off because <span class="smcap">Mr.
 Bodkin</span> could not
attend. One of the judges asked with very natural surprise, "Is not the
man in prison?" upon which the counsel of the "man in prison" got up,
and admitted such to be the fact; but added that he, the "man in
prison," was his (the counsel's) client, and that he (the counsel) was
perfectly willing "to accommodate <span class="smcap">Mr. Bodkin</span>."
 The accommodation of <span class="smcap">Mr.
Bodkin</span> was, no doubt, desirable in its way; but, as the
accommodation of
a prison is not always agreeable, we are disposed to agree with the
learned judge, who thought it rather awkward&#8212;not to say, hard upon "the
man in prison" to have his case adjourned for the convenience of
counsel.</p>

<p>We are disposed to sympathise with the unfortunate who was deprived
of
his liberty, not by his prison's bars, but by a portion of the Bar of
England, which often proves harder and more difficult to contend against
than the most inflexible iron. Nevertheless he, of course, cannot
complain, as although he was shut up in a jail, his own counsel who
represented him in a free and open court was "perfectly satisfied," and
most anxious to "accommodate <span class="smcap">Mr. Bodkin</span>." If
the accommodation could
have been mutual&#8212;if, for example, the prison "accommodation" and the
counsel's "accommodation" could have been in some way equalised&#8212;we
might have seen more justice in the arrangement than either ourselves,
or the learned judge who expressed his surprise on the occasion, have
been able to discover. We must all admire the extreme spirit of
accommodation that prevails among many of "the gentlemen" of the Bar
who&#8212;though they bully each other's clients and witnesses, waste the
money of suitors by neglecting to attend to their briefs, and even
occasionally suffer the postponement of the case of an unfortunate
captive&#8212;are nevertheless always ready to fraternise with their "learned
friends," and make any concessions to each other, of which their clients
have to bear the penalty.</p>

<h2>THEATRICAL NOVELTIES.</h2>

<p>In consequence of the success of <i>The Lancers</i> at the
Princess's&#8212;those
same <i>Lancers</i> being only another version of <i>The Discarded Son</i>
 at the
Adelphi&#8212;the following attractive novelties are in rehearsal, and will
be speedily produced:&#8212;</p>

<blockquote><p>"'<span class="smcap">The Blower of Bubbles</span>'&#8212;being
 a new translation of <i>The Game of
Speculation</i>, acted so many hundred nights at the Lyceum Theatre.
<i>Mercadet, or the Bubble-Blower</i> (with new bubbles to be blown
expressly on this occasion), by <span class="smcap">Mr. Charles Kean</span>.</p>

<p>"'<span class="smcap">The Family of the Whyte Chokers</span>'&#8212;being a
 completely new version
of <i>The Serious Family</i>, which was so popular a season or two ago
at
the Haymarket Theatre. The part of the <i>Reverend Aminadab Whyte
Choker</i>, by <span class="smcap">Mr. Charles Kean</span>, in lieu of <span
 class="smcap">Mr. Buckstone</span>.</p>

<p>"'<span class="smcap">The Mountebank</span>'&#8212;being an improved
reading of <i>Belphegor</i>, as
performed by <span class="smcap">Mr. Webster</span> at the Adelphi
Theatre. <i>The Mountebank</i>
(so long as <i>the public will tolerate it</i>) will be played by <span
class="smcap">Mr.
Charles Kean</span>.</p>

<p>"'<span class="smcap">The Tower of Hammer-and-Nesle</span>'&#8212;being <i>The
 Tower of Nesle</i>, as
generally performed at the Surrey Theatre, but retranslated and
considerably improved, with new causes and effects, and a long
dissertation by <span class="smcap">Mr. Charles Kean</span>, given away
on the playbill, as to
the period and costume of the drama, and a list of the bodies thrown
into the Seine.</p>

<p>"'<span class="smcap">The Carpenter on the Road to Ruin</span>'&#8212;being
 a very superior
translation of a Piece, acted for many years under almost a similar
title, at the Victoria Theatre. <span class="smcap">Mr. Hicks's</span>
favourite part of <i>The
Carpenter</i> by <span class="smcap">Mr. Charles Kean</span>.</p>

<p>"New versions of <i>Pizarro</i>, <i>The Stranger</i>, and <i>The Maid
 and the
Magpie</i> have also been accepted, and will be produced with all the
care for which the Princess's is distinguished."</p></blockquote>

<p>Great hopes are entertained upon the production of the above pieces;
and
there can be no doubt that, having been successful at so many theatres
before, they will be successful again. There can be no fear as to the
acting, when the principal parts will be performed by <span
class="smcap">Mr. Charles Kean</span>
himself.</p>

and a slop-basin&#8212;judging from the mud and "slush" it generally
contains. Whatever may be the accurate name for the utensil in which we

<h2>A REAL SCOTTISH GRIEVANCE.</h2>

<p>Because we think that the Scotch Lion is quite as comfortable in the
place which custom has assigned him as he would be in any other; because
we consider that Scotland will do quite well enough without a separate
Secretary of State; because we are of opinion that Edinburgh should be
content to rank as the second city in the empire; because we are not of
opinion that the dictionary of <span class="smcap">Dr. Johnson</span>
ought, to the vexation of the
author's <i>manes</i>, to be remodelled on a broad Scotch basis;
because, in
short, we are not disposed to treat the imaginary wrongs of Scotchmen
otherwise than with our usual levity, we are not, therefore, disposed to
regard their well-founded complaints with any other feeling than our
occasional seriousness. Now we have&#8212;we cannot say the pleasure to
announce, for the announcement is one which we are grieved in having to
make&#8212;we have the pleasure, such as it is, of pointing out, and calling
attention to, with the view of causing to be redressed, <span
class="smcap">A Real Scottish
Grievance</span>.</p>

<p>The Scottish grievance which we thus proclaim to be real is one
which,
we may say, should be framed and glazed. For it comes before us in the
shape of a lithograph&#8212;dedicated to us in conjunction with a daily paper
of some eminence&#8212;representing the Glasgow General Post Office; a
building of two stories in height, interjacent between <span
class="smcap">Mr. Rutherford's</span>
cigar and snuff establishment, and the shop of <span class="smcap">Mr.
Ruff</span>, clockmaker; a
portion of the party-wall of which last named edifice is exposed, by
reason of a very shameful circumstance, reflecting the discredit of
gross negligence and injustice on the Government, and, indeed, the
Legislature.</p>

<p>That injurious and disgraceful circumstance shall be stated in an
extract from a speech by <span class="smcap">Sir Archibald Alison</span>,
 which is printed beneath
the plate:&#8212;</p>

<blockquote><p>"The revenue from the Post Office in Glasgow has
increased, in ten
years, from £26,000 to £47,000; and, recollect, Glasgow is a city
containing nearly 400,000 inhabitants, being second in importance to
London alone. Well, the Government first bought a building for the
Post Office, for the sake of economy, so ruinous that they were soon
after obliged to take off the two upper stories and having done
that, they were compelled to leave it for two years and a half
without a roof, in the mean while taking no steps to erect a new
office. The result is, that for the greatest commercial city in
Scotland we have no cavalry barracks, no defences of any
description, a Post Office without a roof, and yet, with an amount
of wealth that may prove a tempting prize to an invader."</p></blockquote>

<p>We will not say much about the Cavalry Barracks. Drunkenness, we
know,
prevails to a great extent at Glasgow; and if the people there are apt
to be so disorderly as well as drunk, as not to be controllable by the
ordinary police, perhaps they do require dragoons to repress their
excesses. In that case, it is no doubt a shame that Glasgow should have
no barracks for cavalry. But that the Glasgow Post Office wants a roof,
is a substantial inconvenience and injury, a just cause of complaint, a
matter for strong and sober remonstrance; for remonstrance as
strong&#8212;and as sober&#8212;as Glasgow can make. A roofless house is
disgraceful enough considered as indicating insolvency, but it is much
more disgraceful when its rooflessness is the result of injustice. To
expatiate on the prime necessity of secrecy and security in such a
building as a post office, would be to insult the understanding of our
readers; and we feel that some apology is due for hinting that, of all
the works of masonry, that is the very edifice which ought most
carefully to be tiled in. It is, therefore, with all our power that we
would trumpet&#8212;if with a penny trumpet, though, in fact, ours is a
threepenny trumpet&#8212;the lack of a roof to the Glasgow Post Office as a
real Scottish grievance; and a very great one, particularly as compared
to the others alleged by Scottish agitators. We may add that we
sympathize the more cordially with the parties aggrieved, inasmuch as we
of course regard the condition of the Post Office at Glasgow as fraught
with prejudice and peril to the general cause of letters.</p>

<h2>MODEL RAILWAY MEETING.</h2>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/208.png" alt="A" class="cap" width="40%" />

<p class="cap_3">SATURDAY last a General Annual Special Quarterly
Meeting of the London
and South-Northern Railway Company was held at the Company's Offices.
The meeting had been convened to hear a report on the propriety of
amalgamating the undertaking with that of the Great East And By Eastern
Railway, for which junction, negotiations have been for some time in
progress. The <span class="smcap">Hon. Rolling Stock, M.P.</span>,
Chairman of the former Company,
presided. The room was crowded with shareholders, and eleven fights took
place before business was commenced.</p>
</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span> briefly explained the object
of the meeting, and reminded
those before him that they were men of business come to discuss a
question of business, and he expressed a hope that nothing but business
would be talked, as the riotous displays which had now become common on
such occasions were not only degrading in themselves, but tended to
shake the public confidence in a body which could so conduct itself.
(<i>Applause, and an old hat flung at the Chairman.</i>)</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Secretary</span> then rose to read the
report, but not one word was
audible, shouts of "<i>We know!</i>" "<i>Shut up!</i>" "<i>All humbug!</i>"
 "<i>Gammon
and spinach!</i>" drowning his voice. He persevered in dumb show,
however,
until a volley of baked taturs, nearly all hot, supplied by a vendor who
had been smuggled into the room by a shareholder, made him not only
desist, but come round with an offer to fight the parties who were thus
emphatically protesting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Buffer</span> then moved that the report be
adopted. (<i>Hideous yells.</i>)
Well, if it were objected to, let the reasons be advanced, and don't let
fellows stand there, he added, with some irritation, howling like fools.
(<i>Renewed yelling.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. De Gradient</span> seconded the motion, and
would also be happy to be the
previous speaker's second, if necessary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Shunt</span> said that the Chairman was a
Nass, the directors were umbugs,
and he had no term of decision&#8212;he meant derision&#8212;strong enough for the
secretary, engineer, and superintendent of the traffic. The whole lot
were revolutionary aristocratic donothings and sneaks. (<i>Cries of
"That's about it!</i>" "<i>Put that in your minutes!</i>")</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span> said that in his private
capacity he despised the taunts of
the last speaker too much to condescend to notice them. But as Chairman
of that meeting, and representing its dignity, he felt it his duty to
say that of all the offensive rapscallions whose ridiculous gabble was
ever permitted to contaminate the ears of gentlemen, <span class="smcap">Mr.
 Shunt</span> was at
once the most audacious and the most contemptible. He had no desire to
be severe, but this statement was the mildest version in which he could
clothe the truth. He should now put the motion. (<i>Cries of "Yes, you'd
better!</i>" "<i>Down, down!" and more volleys of baked taturs.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Fitzpiston</span> rose to protest. Not a word
 had been heard of the report,
and yet they were to be asked to adopt it. (<i>Loud applause.</i>)</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>: And whose fault's that? If
the meeting had not made such
an unbusinesslike row, they would have heard it all.</p>

<p>A <span class="smcap">Shareholder</span>: It was a dodge of the
Secretary's, who read low in order
not to be heard.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Secretary</span> (<i>in a dreadful rage</i>):
 If I read low I hit high. Will the
honourable shareholder come round here and try?</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Shareholder</span>: No, you are our menial
servant, and it's your duty to
wait on your masters. (<i>Vollies of applause and taturs.</i>)</p>

<p>The Secretary was here restrained, with some difficulty, by the
Chairman, from taking off his coat and chastising the meeting. During
the discussion, quarrelling was going on in all parts of the room. At
length, the Secretary being appeased into only caricaturing his enemies,
upon his blotting paper, instead of beating them, the Chairman again
rose, and put the motion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Shunt</span> leaped upon the table, and,
taking a sight at the Chair, moved
as an amendment, that the report be pitched out of window, and the
Directors after it. (<i>Applause.</i>)</p>

<p>A <span class="smcap">Director</span> (<i>terrified</i>): Police!</p>

<p>At this word the fury of the meeting became terrific. <i>Cries of
"That's
the way shareholders are bullied!" "No crushers here!"</i> and other
indignant expressions broke forth; and for three-quarters of an hour,
though various speakers tried to be heard, nothing resulted but
gesticulation. At last the meeting, being hoarse, permitted a few words
from</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>, who explained that this question had been already
discussed forty-two times, and each time with similar excitement. In the
meantime another company was pushing on the same scheme, and would, by
reason of the delay, take the wind out of their sails. (<i>Cries of "All
your fault!" "Swindling the shareholders!" "Directors ought to be
kicked!" &amp;c.</i>) He would once more move, that the report be adopted,
as nobody would state any objections. (<i>Vociferous cries and
yells&#8212;"No, no!" "Down with them!" "Twenty-five per cent. or
nothing!" "No democrats!" "No exclusives!" "Bravo</i> <span class="smcap">Rouse</span>!" <i>and so on</i>.)</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span> then called for a show of
hands, when everybody clenched
his fist and shook it furiously at him. The Chairman, with a smile of
triumph, declared the motion unanimously carried, and then, with the
Secretary and the books, made a bolt through a side-door, before the
meeting could rush in upon them, and prevent the success of this <i>ruse</i>.
The meeting broke the windows, chairs, and lamps, and were then
dispersed by the police.</p>

<p>Yet, with such centres of organisation, fault is found with the
working
of the Railway system. There's something wrong.</p>

<h2>PUNCH'S PRIZE JOKE SHOW.</h2>

<p>By way of counteracting the attraction of the Prize Cattle Show,
which
we think fosters a rather questionable taste for looking upon "fatty
deposits," we propose to institute a Prize Joke Show, and we hope that
the produce of the pen of wit will be more satisfactory than the
contents of all the pens in the Bazaar of Baker Street. We candidly
invite competition; and though anything in the shape of "animal matter"
will be rejected from a contest in which all the matter should be as
<i>spirituel</i> as possible, we can only say that <i>Punch</i> will be
happy to
see any of the farfamed Suffolk Punches if, in this "keen encounter of
our wits," they have the courage to show themselves.</p>

<p>As a specimen of the style of Joke that will be admissible into the
contemplated Prize Show, we have the pleasure to "flick off" the
following:&#8212;</p>

<p>If I want a statue of myself, why should I be foolish to present a
sculptor with the marble for the work? <i>Answer.</i> Because if I did,

am married again) upon shaving. To be clean shaved was the prerogative
of a Briton. And now there is a movement for German beards and Cossack
moustachios, which, if permitted, farewell to the British Constitution.
When we look like Roossian slaves and Austrian panders, we shall feel
and act like 'em. Anyways, if beards come in, barbers must go out, in

<h2>THE BRIGHT CITY.</h2>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Earl of Shaftesbury</span> has volunteered an
 epistle eulogistic of
Manchester. "Thoroughfares are opened"&#8212;says the noble lord&#8212;"courts and
alleys cleansed&#8212;drains and sewers constructed," &amp;c. &amp;c. Nothing,
according to the noble lord, will soon be wanting to Manchester to make
it emphatically the Bright City; nothing but&#8212;as <i>Punch</i> opines&#8212;a
little public spirit. "The Turk may go hang so that he buys our goods."
"Liberty in its highest sense, is the liberty to buy and sell." "The
worst worldly evil is a bad shilling." A few of these maxims do
certainly still defile the moral atmosphere of Manchester, cleansed as
the air inhaled may be from the reek of cesspools. <span class="smcap">Mr.
 Bright's</span> hat,
though covering a large, cool head, is nevertheless not big enough to
extinguish the turban of Turkey. "Great spirits"&#8212;says <span

buried under golden mountains." In like manner, sympathy with a noble
cause may be stifled in cotton-bags.</p>

the 16th:&#8212;</p>

<blockquote><p>As Good Housemaid, in a small Family, where a <i>Footman</i>
 is kept, who
is a good <i>needlewoman</i>, who can attend <i>on a lady, with a good
character</i>. Direct A. B. &amp;c., Brompton.</p></blockquote>

<p>We have seen footmen who were justly proud of their "pins", but never
yet saw a footman who was a good needlewoman. But we quite approve of
the advertiser's caution. Being a "good" housemaid, she will serve
nobody but "a lady with a good character". This is very proper, and in
consideration of the virtuous principle displayed, one can forgive the
author's Random Recollections of <span class="smcap">Lindley Murray</span>.</p>

 is a most amusing game. It
is true there is nothing gained by it, but then there is nothing staked.
In fact you may call it, "playing at cards for love."</p>

<h4>"LEFT-OFF CLOTHES FOR THE COLONIES."</h4>

<p>The "old clothes" fraternity are advertising very briskly for
left-off
clothes for the Colonies, with a view, no doubt, to a sort of Holywell
Street aristocracy that some people are desirous of establishing in
Australia. Considering the many scamps that have attained to wealth at
the "diggins," and knowing the slavish precedence that is always
accorded to the possessors of gold, we may anticipate a peerage of
regular "roughs," should an "Upper Chamber" be established at the
Antipodes. The old clothes movement, in taking a colonial direction,
shows a sympathy with the contemplated exportations of aristocratic
distinctions to the New World, at a time when the Old World is
exhibiting leniency to throw aside its old worn-out habits. Among the
"left off clothes" we presume it will be a good speculation to include a
few "coats of arms" for the use of the Antipodean aristocracy.</p>

<h2>THE ROYAL EXCHANGE CLOCK.</h2>

<p>It is a common saying in the City and elsewhere that "Time is money,"
and we cannot wonder at the existence of the maxim, when we look at the
cost, of the representative of time at the Royal Exchange&#8212;no less than
£2605 0<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> having been paid for the Exchange Clock.
This sum is
at the rate of about £217 per hour, taking the clock to consist of the
usual number of hours, or nearly £40 per minute, if we make a
calculation rather more minute.</p>

<p>The cost of the Clock is made up of a variety of items, which, for
the
enlightenment of the public, we subjoin.</p>

<table summary="cost of clock" align="center">
<tbody><tr><td></td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;£&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>&nbsp;s.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>d.</i></td></tr>

</tbody></table>

<p>It must be inferred from this, that after the Clocks had been
purchased
for £700, it resembled the donkey "what wouldn't go," and as there was
nobody to cry "Gee Wo!" with the expenditure, £224 18<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
 was sunk
in alterations. As if the Clock itself was not sufficiently costly, it
was proposed to convert it into a toy by having bells and chimes
attached to it, which have already caused an outlay to the tune of
upwards of One Thousand Pounds&#8212;a very pretty tune, no doubt, but
hitherto the only tune to which the Bells and Chimes have contributed,
for they cannot be got into play anyhow. The Common Council, however,
will not admit there has been anything wrong in the matter, because
"<span class="smcap">Professor Airey</span> declares the bells and clock
 the most beautiful
specimens of workmanship ever seen." We should have thought that bells
and clocks were to be heard rather than seen; and that a clock, like the
costermonger's horse, might be excused for being a "rum un to look at,"
if it's being a "good un to go" could be relied upon. The approval of
<span class="smcap">Professor Airey</span> may be very satisfactory as
far as it goes, but until we
can look upon the loss of £2605 0<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> as an airy
nothing, we can
hardly reconcile ourselves to the facts we have called attention to.</p>

<h2>NEWS FROM THE THEATRE OF WAR.</h2>

<p>Our latest news from the Theatre of War is from Astley's Theatre,
where
the War with Russia is being carried out with unflagging energy. Last
night the Russians had entrenched themselves in a strong position in
front of the enemy, and the Russian General, <span class="smcap">Widdicomb</span>,
 turned the right
wing&#8212;a wrong one having been turned by the negligence of a
scene-shifter. The enemy were in position at nine o'clock, and a French
officer made towards a standard, which he eventually carried. On
Saturday afternoon a body of Russian soldiers received their pay from
the treasury, which is understood to be amply supplied.</p>

<p>In the evening the battle was resumed with great vigour; but both
parties eventually laid down their arms. The Russians were much
harassed, and set fire to Moscow in several places with bits of tow
steeped in spirits of wine. The city burnt with great fury for nearly an
entire minute, when it was terminated by a decisive blow from the mouth
of the master carpenter.</p>

<p class="cap_3">THE other day we read an account of a few complimentary

been spoken by the <span class="smcap">Emperor of Russia</span> to a
French Opera dancer, from
which some <i>Gobemouche</i> had drawn the inference that there would be
 no

announce that there is no possibility of any collision between France
and England. At one of the performances of <span class="smcap">"Tom"

<h2>OUR TOURIST IN PARIS.&#8212;No. 11.</h2>

<p>"Oh, I say!" says old <span class="smcap">Martingale</span>, bursting
 in upon the Tourist's morning
meal, "I saw such a stunning play last night. Don't mind my weed, eh? I
am not much of a playgoer myself, you know. You haven't got any Curaçoa
I suppose? Oh, yes, Kirsch will do, thank you. Especially here, they
speak so quick I can't follow 'em. <span class="smcap">Franconi's</span>
 more my line. But I tell
you what, the piece last night was a fizzer, and no mistake; and a
fellow sung no end of a good song in it," continued the dramatic
enthusiast, jingling half-a-dozen sovereigns in his two hands in time to
the tune he hummed, "Chink chink, chink chink, toodle um tum ti, chink
chink, chink chink, toodle um tum ti. Clipping, by Jove; all about women
not caring for love, or hops, and that kind of thing, but only for tin.
How it must have riled them. I believe it's quite true, and yet&#8212;I don't
know either. Some of one sort, and some of another, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Oh, I can't tell you the plot. It's a young fellow who goes away
from
home, the reprobate, and falls into what is called "bad company", and
one of the bad company pretends to be spooney on him, and it's all very
jolly at first. He swells about and spends a tremendous lot of tin, in
the same way that <span class="smcap">Tom Hilton</span> and fellows of
that sort are doing now.
Horses, and dinners, and champagne, and jewellery; nothing is too good
for him. And then, to mend matters, he takes to play, and of course is
extensively legged by others of the bad company, and is ruined, in
short. He tries to hold on by borrowing of old <i>Shixty-per-Shent</i>,
just
like fellows we know in town; and he comes to grief, and the mercenary
female cuts him when she finds it out; and it's very affecting.
Everybody cried all round the house; and, upon my word, I couldn't help
doing a little in that way myself. Now, mind you go and see it. I intend
to go every night till I know that song by heart." And he went away,
warbling "Chink chink, chink chink," and smacking the sovereigns in his
pocket.</p>

<p>More difficult critics than <span class="smcap">Martingale</span> had
 spoken well of the last of
that chain of dramas in which <i>Lais</i> is made the heroine, and the
bad or
good side of her character is the point of interest. The Tourist,
therefore, willingly installed himself with his double-barrel in a
<i>fauteuil d'orchestre</i>, and was forced to acknowledge the admirable
constructive skill with which French dramatists ply their craft. No
wonder our practical fellow-countrymen are tempted to carry off such
capital ready-made articles, instead of being at the pains of hatching
their own clumsy originals. Equally admirable was the acting for case,
gaiety, and power. At the pathetic parts the audience wept freely, as my
friend had said. There was no shame or reserve. One old fellow, with a
cropped head and great grizzled beard, was quite inconsolable. He mopped
his face with a red cotton handkerchief, and sobbed as if his heart
would break. The severe moral of the piece seemed to displease certain
ladies in beautiful bonnets, who murmured disapprobation. The satire
conveyed by the piquant "chink chink" was overcharged; but the honest
<i>bourgeoisie</i> drowned all discontent with obstreperous applause.
They
had no doubt whatever that <i>Lais</i> was quite as bad as she was
represented.</p>

<p>Before the audience had well dried their tears by a promenade in the
<i>foyer</i>, they were all laughing themselves into fits over a comic
piece&#8212;which certainly was very funny&#8212;about the children of Albion. A
party of French pleasure-seekers find themselves in the full-flavoured
and highly-coloured atmosphere of London, and enter an hotel kept by a
lady in a straw hat and Highland kilt. (The fashions of dear old England
have, apparently, varied somewhat since the wanderer left her shores.)
To every demand for victual or drink made by the famished travellers,
the short-petticoated lady replies that it is impossible, <i>parceque
c'est Sonday.</i> And the whole party come forward to sing in the
pleasant
manner of French vaudevilles, <i>"C'est Sonday, Sonday, Sonday"</i>
&amp;c. and
make everybody laugh very much. Certainly it was a perfectly good
natured joke, and after they had lashed themselves in the drama we could
not complain of being tickled in the farce.</p>

<p>A nice old gentleman who occupied the next stall to the Tourist, and
availed himself of Monsieur's lorgnette, asked whether we love to
ridicule Frenchmen in a like manner on our stage; and, being answered in
the negative, seemed disposed to congratulate himself that his
countrymen were free from ridiculous customs, follies and vices.</p>

<p>"Pardon, my dear Sir: behold all the difference. Your writers are
spiritual and ingenious, but they want one thing&#8212;conscientiousness.
They care little for truth and justice if they can only say a good
thing. The piece which has diverted us both so much supposes an audience
as ignorant of us and of our manners as if we were Tartars or Japanese.
A sketch so coarse and unfaithful could not be presented to even the
least instructed play-goers of London. Forty years ago, I confess, when
we had no intercourse with your charming Paris, they would have received
it with delight at the first theatre of the King. But now they know too
much; and any of our writers who should set himself to laugh at the
grand nation without careful and candid observation of them in their own
country, would be only making <i>himself</i> ridiculous. Now the more a
traveller becomes familiar with the people amongst whom he lives, the
less occasion he finds to smile at their peculiarities. He discovers
good sense where at first he only saw eccentricity, and the material for
mockery crumbles away when he attempts to grasp it. And hence it arises,
my dear Sir, that almost the only sure way to raise a laugh in England
against your witty compatriots is to carry out and improve their
ignorant caricatures of us."</p>

<p>"Monsieur, it is impossible to say anything more true or more
profound.
Permit me to hope that, as the two sisters recognise each other's noble
traits, they will never smile to deride, but only in admiration."</p>

<h2>RUSSIAN REVOLUTIONISTS.</h2>

<p>The Russians are not commonly supposed to be revolutionists, though
the
slaves of a sanguinary Autocrat are just as bad as Red Republicans.
However it appears that they have embraced that revolution in naval
warfare which is destined to result from the adoption of <span
class="smcap">Colt's</span>
Revolver. Armed with this instrument, these tools of absolutism are
likely, in effect, to prove the most destructive levellers; flooring
their antagonists left and right. Should these antagonists ever be
British Tars, it will be a disgrace to the Admiralty if the <span
class="smcap">Queen's</span>
sailors have no better weapons than the superseded old pistol and common
cutlass wherewith to encounter the crew of <span class="smcap">Nicholas</span>.
 It is to be hoped
that they will be supplied, without delay, with arms that will place
them on an equality with whatsoever foe they may be called upon to
conquer; so that they may defy old <span class="smcap">Nicholas</span>
and all his crew, and repel
all other assaults of the enemy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plutarch</span> delighted in parallels: <i>Punch</i>
 takes pleasure in the like
intellectual exercise. Our friend of the <i>Notes and Queries</i> speaks
 of a
"vast <i>quantity</i> of donkeys" at Malvern (for at that favoured place
donkeys are measured by the peck and bushel). And amongst these donkeys
was, until lately, a very superior ass named, for certain achievements
performed in the cause of the late <span class="smcap">Queen Adelaide</span>,
 the "<i>Royal</i> Moses."
It seems that the good <span class="smcap">Queen</span> was wont to be
carried on the back of
Moses&#8212;at the time simply Moses, and no more&#8212;to the summit of the thymy
hills of Malvern; Moses, no doubt, inwardly rejoiced and comforted by a
knowledge, or at least suspicion, of the preciousness of the burden (for
he carried £100,000 per annum) that honoured him; for even asses have
shrewd instincts in the presence of the Royal and the great. Well, <span
 class="smcap">Her
Majesty</span> being about to leave Malvern, rewards the old woman whose
property Moses is: at the same time, with her wonted benevolence,
inquiring if she could do any further service, likely, in this world of
nice distinctions, to give&#8212;in return for the many rides on Moses&#8212;the
old woman a lift. After a while, pondering the matter, the old woman
said&#8212;"Please your <span class="smcap">Blessed Majesty</span>, give a
name to my donkey." Now, as
the animal was an ass upon four legs, there was no precedent for
bestowing upon him a baronetcy or even a knighthood: he could not be
called <span class="smcap">Sir Moses Asinus, Bart</span>.&#8212;neither dubbed
 simply <span class="smcap">Sir Moses</span>.
Otherwise, in the latter case, we doubt not the good-natured <span
class="smcap">Queen</span>,
calling for a bulrush from the ponds of Malvern, the donkey sagaciously
going upon his knees, would have been melodiously commanded to "Rise,
<span class="smcap">Sir Moses</span>." The four legs, however, stood in
the way of such an honour.
Therefore, <span class="smcap">Queen Adelaide</span>, looking
benevolently upon the donkey,
said&#8212;"Henceforth, be known to all men as the ROYAL <span class="smcap">Moses</span>."
 A peck of
beans would, probably have been quite as acceptable as the regal prefix;
nevertheless, the ass&#8212;like the ass of <i>Peter Bell</i>&#8212;</p>

<div class="poem1"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"&#8212;&#8212; the ass, with motion dull,</p>
<p class="i0">Turn'd, on the pivot of his skull,</p>
<p class="i6">His long left ear!"</p>
</div></div>

<p>The dignity was thus loyally acknowledged by the ennobled donkey, and
<span class="smcap">Queen Adelaide</span> departed. And the glory of the
 Royal Moses grew exceeding
bright. Everybody would ride him. "That roan shall be my throne," cries
<i>Hotspur</i>. "For that Moses I proposes," cried every Cockney
visitor.
What was the result? No ass could bear to be so put upon. The ass died;
but&#8212;it is said&#8212;has left several sons behind him; one and all called,
even as the sire,"The Royal Moses". But this is a miserable
imposture&#8212;an ignorant, wretched ambition. Asses&#8212;assuredly asses on
four legs&#8212;have no hereditary titles. There can be but one Royal
Moses&#8212;the sons are simply donkeys, and no more.</p>

<p>And London supplies a parallel with Malvern. Once upon a time there
was
a Mayor. Now, this Mayor would take upon himself the burden of the
reputation of a Royal Prince; would carry it at public meetings; would
especially insist on trotting with it into Hyde Park? And for what
purpose? We&#8212;<i>Punch</i>&#8212;have written to the old woman at Malvern, the
owner of the dead Royal Moses, to inquire of her&#8212;(for at a critical
moment she proved herself a shrewd, worldly-wise old woman)&#8212;to inquire
her opinions upon the conduct of our <span class="smcap">Mayor</span>,
self-burthened with the
crystal glory of a gracious <span class="smcap">Prince</span>. We have
received her answer, and
duly give it:&#8212;</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">To Mr. Punch</span>,&#8212;The owner of the Royal
Moses as was, of <span class="smcap">Queen Adelaide</span>
of blessed memory [<i>this is writ for me by the Parish Clerk</i>],
presents
her duty to <i>Mr. Punch</i>, and searching her own bosom for what was
there
when she was emboldened to ask a favour of <span class="smcap">Her
Majesty</span>&#8212;</p>

<p>"The owner of the Royal Moses as was (his sons are like him, as beans
are like beans) thinks the <span class="smcap">Mare</span> as <i>will</i>
 trot about with the <span class="smcap">Prince</span>,
only does it that he may&#8212;copying of me&#8212;say, 'Please your Royal
Highness to give a name to my donkey, or mare, as the case may be.'</p>

<p>"And this, <i>Mr. Punch</i>, is my belief, judging from the secrets
of my own
breast. And am</p>

<p class="regards">"Your Humble and Dutiful Servant,<br />
"The owner of the Royal Moses,</p>
<p class="author">"Her <b>X</b> mark."</p>

<p>"P.S.&#8212;Donkeys always on hand."</p>

<p>"Thus, the old dame of Malvern, divining aright, our <span
class="smcap">Challis</span> may ask, or
hint&#8212;"Please your Royal Highness, give a handle to my challice".</p>

<hr />

<h2>OBITUARY A LITTLE IN ADVANCE.</h2>

<p>Died the other day, by Act of Parliament, that time-honoured old
nuisance, the City of London: very sincerely execrated by all who knew
it, its civic brethren alone perhaps excepted. Though sudden at last,
its death, by no means, was an unexpected one: for in the public
estimation it was known that the deceased had long been sinking. Among
the causes which chiefly led to its dissolution, we believe especial
prominence must be given to its fondness for good living. Its favourite
dish perhaps was turtle soup, of which its consumption was habitually
enormous. We believe it has been even known to devour as many as four
hundred quarts at a single dinner.</p>

<p>Gluttony, however, was not its only failing. Its love of "good
things"
was by no means confined to those of the dinner-table: for its appetite
for venison was more than equalled by its thirst for wealth. We might
enumerate many acts of extortion by which its existence was rendered
infamous. The blackest of these however was, we think, its coal-tax; of
which its imposition was regarded as such, in more than one sense of the
substantive, being justly complained of, as a burning shame, by all who
suffered from it.</p>

<p>Another failing of the deceased was its utter want of taste&#8212;in
everything but what had emanated from the kitchen. Of this the strongest
instance was its strenuous upholding of Temple Bar: an ugly structure,
but for the keeping up of which people had to pay pretty handsomely. Nor
was its sense of smell less impaired, apparently, than that of taste: as
was shown especially by the strange degree of fondness it evinced for
Smithfield Market, although that place was continually in bad odour.</p>

<p>Throughout its existence, the deceased was extremely subject to
fits&#8212;of
indiscretion&#8212;which it is thought materially impaired its constitution.
Perhaps the most distressing of these was that which annually recurred
on the 9th of November, when it experienced for hours a congestion of
its arteries, which seriously impeded its vital circulation. In some of
its later paroxysms, the deceased so far forgot itself as to betray a
slight attention to the Arts, to which it previously had maintained the
most complete indifference&#8212;except, indeed, to that which we now see
daily advertised as the "Art of Dining."</p>

<p>It is expected that the funeral will take place in the middle of next
week, when the <span class="smcap">Lord Mayor</span> of course will
officiate as Chief Mourner.
Service will be performed by one of the Sheriffs, whose officers have
long discharged that duty. We are not aware that any monument will be
erected to the deceased, though a column to its memory will probably be
placed in the pages of our contemporaries.</p>

<hr />

<h4>Temple-Bar must be Removed.</h4>

<p>The past week affords another argument for the removal of Temple-Bar.
 On
Tuesday last, a distinguished Alderman having to go west, was stopped by
the fog at Temple-Bar. Fog and alderman were both so thick, it was
impossible that both could go through together. We have not heard how
the dilemma was settled.</p>

<h2>THE FRENCH "FUSION" AT FROHSDORF.</h2>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/214.png" alt="T" class="cap" width="40%" />

<p class="cap_2">THE papers announced the other day in "second
editions," by "submarine
and electric telegraph," the important fact that "the <span
class="smcap">Duke de Nemours</span>
had called on the <span class="smcap">Count de Chambord</span> at
Frohsdorf;" and a subsequent
communication brought the equally important intelligence that the <span
class="smcap">Prince
de Chambord</span> had since returned the call. How it can signify to
Europe in
general, or to England in particular, to be told that these two princes
are now on visiting terms is a puzzle to us, who look upon the affair
with as much unconcern as we should have felt at the intimation that
<span class="smcap">Jones</span> had been to <span class="smcap">Robinson's</span>,
 and that <span class="smcap">Robinson</span> had returned <span
class="smcap">Jones's</span>
card. We suppose, however, that the electric telegraph will speedily be
put into requisition to communicate the progress of the fusion through
all its stages, from the first interchange of the conventional
pasteboard, to the final drawing up of a family compact. We shall expect
to meet with such passages as the following in the columns of our
contemporaries before the end of the month:&#8212;</p>
</div>
<p>"<i>By Submarine and Electric Telegraph.</i>&#8212;The <span class="smcap">Count
 de Chambord</span> asked the
<span class="smcap">Duke de Nemours</span> to breakfast this morning,
and the <span class="smcap">Duke de Nemours</span>
returned the compliment by inviting the <span class="smcap">Prince de
Chambord</span> to tea in the
afternoon."</p>

<p>"<i>By Special Courier from Vienna.</i>&#8212;The representative of the
elder
branch of the House of Bourbon has offered a cigar to the representative
of the Orleans family, who has acknowledged the courtesy by presenting
his illustrious relative with a <i>fusee</i> to light his Havannah.</p>

<p>"<i>Latest from Frohsdorf.</i>&#8212;The <span class="smcap">Count de
Chambord</span> and the <span class="smcap">Duke de Nemours</span>
are now, at near midnight, drinking grog together. The elder branch
poured in the water; the younger branch has added the spirits; each of
the royal personages acted as spoon, and after a stirring interview of
several seconds, the fusion may be considered to have been complete."</p>

<hr />

<h2>SHOCKING LOW CHURCH!</h2>

<p>It is proposed by certain well-meaning persons, to erect ragged
churches
on purpose only for the poor, the wretched, and the ragged. Probably a
church of this sort will be built in the district of <span class="smcap">St.
 Giles</span>; to be
dedicated, however, in honour of <span class="smcap">St. James</span>,
the patron saint, whatever
his square may think, of ill-dressed church-goers. We are getting on in
matters of this kind. We are making a sort of railway progress. By and
by we shall have churches for different sets of people; first, second,
and third class churches. They will be churches of different orders, not
only architectural but social. Perhaps the third class won't be covered
in, and in that case it might be constructed on the simplest model of a
Greek Temple; the rather, as the whole arrangement would certainly look
somewhat pagan.</p>

<p>Matters being thus in train&#8212;rather on the broad gauge line, with an
inferior terminus, some may say&#8212;the adoption of steam-organs might be
suggested, together with the substitution of locomotives for clergymen,
as soon as scientific improvement shall enable us to construct such
engines, capable of performing their duties mechanically.</p>

<p>The Ragged Churches, we suppose, will be built of ragstone; the
pulpit-cushion, the altar-cloth, will be all rags. The clergy will
officiate in tatters; so as to preclude the possibility of any surplice
controversy, by rendering it impossible to tell what kind of vestments
they have on. The church will be ragged, the parson ragged, the
congregation ragged&#8212;all ragged together. Perhaps, also, the doctrine
ought, in a manner, to be ragged too; for, suppose the Church Triumphant
to correspond to the Church Militant, and it would be requisite to
preach a Ragged Heaven. And though there is one place for the poor and
another for the rich in this world, it will be well for the rich if
there is not one place for themselves and another for the poor in the
next.</p>

<h4>How to Prolong the Life of a Secret.</h4>

<p>If a secret is a little weak, and looks as if it was likely to die,
there is nothing for recovering it equal to a cup of tea&#8212;but then the
tea must be administered by the hand of a lady, rather advanced in
years. After a cup or so, the secret will imbibe fresh strength, and
will be good for, at least, another ten years. N.B. This remedy has
never been known to fail, more especially if there happen to be two or
three elderly ladies present, and they take good care, at the time the
secret is recovering, to give the poor thing plenty of circulation.</p>

<h4>SCENES AT THE JUDGES' CHAMBERS.</h4>

<p>The "grandeur of the law," however obvious it may be when represented
 by
ermine (at a guinea a yard) and horsehair (at fifteen shillings a pound)
in Westminster Hall, is certainly not very adequately supported at the
Judges' Chambers. These judicial tenements are situated in the vicinity

<h4>AN IMPORTANT NOTE AND QUERY.</h4>

<p>According to the return moved for by <span class="smcap">Mr. Hume</span>,
 we find that, including
Porters, and Gentlemen to Great Seal, Sealer and Deputy Sealer, Chaffwax
and Deputy Chaffwax, (what on earth <i>is</i> a Deputy Chaffwax???)
Clerk of
the Hanaper, and Deputy Clerk of the Hanaper, Ushers, Heralds, Garter
Kings at Arms, Purse-bearers, Marshals, Lord Chancellors, Engrossing
Clerks, Attorney-Generals, stamps, taxes, and other equally necessary
and indispensable persons, places, and things&#8212;the making of a Baron is
done for the trifling charge of £420. Thanks to <span class="smcap">Mr.
Hume</span>, we are put in
possession of this Hume-orous document. But the most important question
to an Englishman remains unsolved; and <span class="smcap">Mr. Bull</span>
 requests us to make
inquiries, whether it will cost him this great sum before he can make
his appearance at the Royal table on Christmas Day next, as a Baron of
Beef?</p>

<h2>VISIT OF THE THAMES AND MEDWAY</h2>

<center><small>TO THE</small></center><br />

<center>ROYAL COMMISSIONERS OF THE CITY.</center>

<p>The inhabitants of Parliament Street were lately thrown into a state
of
great excitement by the appearance of a lady and gentleman, who came out
of one of the lanes leading from the river, and asked every one whom
they met to show them where the Royal Commissioners were sitting. The
gentleman, who rather surlily informed the too curious crowd that he was
<span class="smcap">Father Thames</span>, was attired in a quaint and
singular garb. "All round his
head" he wore, not merely "a green willow," but a profusion of reeds,
rullies, and osiers, whilst his feet and legs were thickly coated with
mud and sand, which made one of the bystanders (a Common Councilman on
his way to the Commissioners) observe, that "the stranger's lower
extremities were most in need of the <i>hosiers</i>." His waist was
garnished
by a quantity of bricks, beams, planks, and piles, strung round him
without any regard to order or symmetry, and, by their bulk and weight,
greatly impeding his progress. He carried his well-known urn under his
arm, like an opera hat; but, on passing a window in which <span
class="smcap">Ransome's</span>
Patent Filters were exposed for sale, he looked wistfully at them, and
observed to his companion, that he should like to swop the urn against
one. A Kentish farmer (one of a deputation who had been explaining to
the Home Secretary the connection between the Bank Charter and the
disease in the hops) recognised in the lady an old friend named <span
class="smcap">Medway</span>,
who is in the habit of staying on his estate for some months in every
year. She had dressed her head with wild-flowers of every hue; her gown
"was a blue watered silk; and from her waist hung, by way of
<i>châtelaine</i>, a string of locks. A number of keys graced her
companion's
girdle", but we are unable to say if his quays belonged to her locks.</p>

<p>Upon the introduction of these illustrious characters to the Royal
Commission the usual question&#8212;"Have you anything to say about the
Corporation?"&#8212;was put to them, and <span class="smcap">Father Thames</span>
 at once gave his
evidence, in his usual flowing style:</p>

<p>"Had for many years been committed to the care of the Corporation,
but
had received at their hands nothing but ill treatment. Remembered that
many aquatic plants once adorned the whole course of his stream. Had
been told by worthy <span class="smcap">Master Camden</span> that those
curious botanists, <span class="smcap">Dr.
Plukenet</span> and <span class="smcap">Mr. Doody</span>, found on the
Thames at Westminster, bitter
cresses, the three-cornered bulrush, the water reed grass with an
oat-like pannicle, and a great pond-weed with pellucid leaves. Believed
that the same locality could not now produce a reed worth a rush.
Remembered that salmon, lampreys, mullet, and other fish, used to ascend
his stream above Westminster, until the Corporation suffered that stream
to be polluted by various abominations. Never saw any fish now,
excepting those which were thrown in, dead, by the clerk of the markets.
Had heard of Whitebait; but had never seen any. Believed them to be no
fish&#8212;but a composition of lard, flour, and gold-beaters' skin. Had some
Swans still, but they never sang now. Did not think any one would listen
to them if they did, as 'The Song of the Turtle' had superior
attractions. Remembered to have heard three of them singing 'Water
parted from the Sea,' to <span class="smcap">Mr. Pope</span>, one
evening, at Twickenham. On
another occasion, had heard <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>, the Water
 Poet, trying to teach them
'A Boat, a Boat unto the Ferry.' Believed they ceased to sing when the
City gave up its poet laureate. Thought there should be Writers to the
Cygnet in London, as well as in Edinburgh, but they must not write in
Scotch, as the swans would sing no Scotch song, except, perhaps, "Wha'll
buy Caller Herrin?" Had not seen a Naiad for many years, and thought the
last had emigrated to Ball's Pond, and set up as a clear starcher. Had
been much reduced in size by these and other troubles, but regretted to
say the Corporation had taken advantage of his diminished channel to
build upon his sides. Had been accused of shifting his bed. So would the
Corporation, if their bed had been filled with mud and shingle. Thought
they should have kept his bed cleaner. Would like to alter the old
proverb, for their benefit, and wished that 'as they had made his bed,
so they might lie in it.'"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Father Thames</span> having concluded his
evidence, his sister <span class="smcap">Medway</span> was about
to offer her statement of grievances, when an usher announced that the
<span class="smcap">Water Bailiff</span> was coming up stairs. Upon
which the two rivers, with,
fear and perturbation in their countenances, scuttled out of a side door
in dread of meeting that terrible functionary.</p>

<hr />

<h4>A Bad Spec.</h4>

<p>News has arrived that "the Russians had invested Giurgevo, but were
not
strong enough to attack." We can only say that the "investment" must
have been rather an unprofitable affair.</p>

<h2>PENAL DANCING FOR THE PROTECTION OF WOMEN.</h2>

<p>In a quadrille&#8212;composed, we think, by the ingenious <span
class="smcap">M. Jullien</span>&#8212;a
lively and diverting effect is produced by the cracking of a whip, which
forms an accompaniment of the tune which the company are supposed to
dance to.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">William Curtis</span>, a tailor, according to the
 Police Reports, was brought
the other day before the <span class="smcap">Lord Mayor</span>, at the
Mansion House, for having
cruelly beaten and attempted to murder his wife; who stated on
evidence&#8212;which was corroborated by a policeman&#8212;that he ripped up her
stays with a penknife, took the bone out of them, and beat her with the
bone till it broke in three pieces; then beat her with her hair-brush,
dragged her out of bed, tried to strangle her, and beat her again with a
large square-cut stick&#8212;declaring that if she dared to call out for
assistance he would dance upon her body.</p>

<p>The quadrille above-mentioned supplies a hint in regard to <span
class="smcap">Mr. Curtis's</span>
notion of a dance. <span class="smcap">Mr. William Curtis</span> is an
uneducated man. He has not
been taught how to behave himself to the gentler sex. He wants a little
instruction in deportment, to which dancing should be added, as his
ideas concerning that accomplishment are evidently barbarous. <span
class="smcap">Mr. Curtis</span>
should have been sent to <span class="smcap">Mr. Calcraft's</span>
Dancing Academy, and there have
been taught to dance with fettered heels to the smack of the lash
resounding on his own bare back.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Lord Mayor</span> consigned <span
class="smcap">Mr. Curtis</span> to Holloway Prison and hard labour
for six months, to give him, as his Lordship said, an opportunity for
reflection and repentance. But the dancing lessons&#8212;two, or even three,
perhaps, would not have been too many&#8212;were wanting to render the
reflection profitable and the repentance sincere. They would have given
him an opportunity for reflecting on the nature of stripes and blows,
and for repenting of having inflicted such injuries on a woman.</p>

<p>Another tailor, <span class="smcap">James Wright</span>, also
brought before the <span class="smcap">Lord Mayor</span> on the
same day for the like offence, had hit his wife twice on the head with a
sleeveboard, cutting open her skull in three places, had struck her with
his fist in the face, and continued to knock her about for three or four
minutes. At the Thames Police Office, likewise on the same day, <span
class="smcap">James
Cropley</span>, a Lancashire collier, was charged with committing an
assault
upon his wife, which consisted in felling her to the earth by dealing
her a blow in the face with a heavy stick that knocked her nose flat.
Six months' imprisonment and hard labour only, were the sentences on
these gentlemen also. No blame to the <span class="smcap">Mayor</span>
or the Magistrate. The law
at present unfortunately does not empower them to enter such savages at
the School of Correction for the extra of penal dancing.</p>

<p>Since these cases, others of similar atrocity have occurred, and
continue to occur so frequently as to suggest the existence of a
downright mania for wife-beating. In other forms of mania the whip has
happily been disused; but it is the only cure for this. There is clearly
no other help. Cure?&#8212;preventive we should rather say. Dastards&#8212;with
the fear of the scourge before their eyes&#8212;have ceased to assail the
Royal person, and would very soon begin to respect that of the mere
female subject. Thus the possibility of being whipped would restrain
them from rendering themselves liable to whipping; a consideration which
quite conquers the repugnance one feels at the thought of lashing a
human being&#8212;if such a phrase can be applied to a brute. Whipcord,
therefore, would never, probably, have to whistle, or thong to crack, to
the howl of any such ruffian after all: but, if occasion were given for
such music, we must say our ears would not be too delicate to bear it.</p>

<p>The present <span class="smcap">Home Secretary</span> is evidently
determined to keep his
department in order, and may doubtless be depended upon for making Home
tolerable to a poor woman, in as far as he can, by warranting her such
protection as a cat-o'-nine-tails can afford against the ferocity of a
brutal husband.</p>

<hr />

<h4>That's the Way the Money Goes.</h4>

<p>A law-suit has lately been reported in all the papers, with the
appropriate heading of "<span class="smcap">Money</span> <i>versus</i> <span
 class="smcap">Money</span>." Considering that law is
generally the madness of many for the gain of the few&#8212;namely the
lawyers&#8212;we think Money against Money would be a good title to almost
every cause that is tried.</p>

<h2>THE SCOTCH PEERAGE IN PERIL.</h2>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/218.png" alt="S" class="cap" width="30%" />

<p class="cap_2">SCOTLAND, having begun to complain of its wrongs, seems
 in danger of
being inundated by incessant showers of grievances. We cannot be
surprised that Scotland should itch to have her injuries redressed; and
we have now another to add to the long catalogue of complaints that have
recently issued from the North Britishers. The following paragraph from
the <i>Spectator</i> of last week brings to light a new calamity:&#8212;</p>
</div>

<blockquote><p>"The floor of the picture gallery in Holyrood Palace is
become so
rotten and unsafe, that when Peers assemble to elect a
representative, the greatest caution is requisite to prevent
disaster. The Commissioners of Woods and Forests are about to
provide the proper remedy of a new floor."</p></blockquote>

<p>It is evident from the above account, that there is something very
rotten in the foundation which the Scotch Peers have to rest upon. It
would seem that when the Scotch lairds assemble to elect a
representative, they are obliged to "tread softly," not because theirs
is "hallowed ground," but because it is crumbling away like the
rottenest specimen of a Pierage which the banks of the Thames, with its
tottering tiers of worn-out barges, could furnish. We can imagine the
heavy Scotch Peers proceeding to an election with such caution, as to be
compelled to avoid every hole in the floor, lest any of them should
inadvertently put their foot in it. We shall not be surprised to hear,
some day, that when the members had assembled on the floor of the house
for the despatch, of business, they went completely through with it.</p>

<hr />

<h2>THE "FUSION" OF THE BEERBUNG COUSINS.</h2>

<center>(<i>From our Rotherhithe Correspondent.</i>)</center>

<p>"I hasten to inform you of an event, which, if the estimate of the
actors themselves is to be taken, will cause the utmost excitement
throughout this country and the Continent. On this subject your readers
will be judges&#8212;in a petty locality small things seem large&#8212;and the
preternatural importance which is here given to it may deceive me into
false calculations.</p>

<p>"You, like the rest of the world, are well aware that a feud of no
ordinary virulence has subsisted between the elder and younger branches
of the house of <span class="smcap">Beerbung</span>, which so long
supplied all the Publicans (and
a good many of the sinners) to this locality, and indeed dictated to the
magistrates of Limehouse, and defied the authorities of the Commercial
Docks. You remember that when <span class="smcap">Lewis Beerbung</span>
lost his license, and the
'King's Head' was shut up, things went on anyhow in the parish;
everybody opened public-houses, keeping the shutters down Sunday and
week-day alike, and at last we hardly knew whether our heads were on our
shoulders or not. Then the military came in, and we got on better; and,
subsequently, the other <span class="smcap">Lewis Beerbung</span> (who
was given to oysters) and
his brother, <span class="smcap">Charles Dicks</span>, had the 'King's
Head' again. <span class="smcap">Dicks</span> took in
preachers, and cheated in his measures, and at last ran off to Scotland;
and then the house was let to a third <span class="smcap">Lewis</span>,
who was son to the first
<span class="smcap">Lewis Beerbung's</span> younger brother, a very bad
fellow, of whom <span class="smcap">Jack Ketch</span>
had the last accounts. The <span class="smcap">Beerbungs</span> were
always a queer set, and this
third <span class="smcap">Lewis</span>, though a clever fellow, could
not keep the house (which he
had named the 'Pear and Umbrella'), but had to run for it, and was made
bankrupt under the name of <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Then the
whole affair was altered: a
committee was appointed to manage the house, which had a new sign, the
'Three Jolly Colours:' and since that the chairman has kicked out the
rest of the managers, and has got the licence transferred to himself.
The house is now the 'Bee and Bayonet,' and seems to be carried on to
the satisfaction of the neighbourhood. Very good order is kept; the
chairman, who was formerly in the Ham, and, indeed, sausage line, has
married a very nice woman, and tries to keep friends with the most
respectable people about. Indeed, his behaviour to a rich and rascally
tallow-monger, who has been trespassing on the land of some poor
neighbours, and stealing their turkey, has sent up <span class="smcap">Unlimited
 Loo</span>, as
he's called, in the estimation of all decent folks. Anyhow, he has got
the house which was the 'King's Head,' and, while he gives Imperial
measures, will keep it.</p>

<p>"But as the <span class="smcap">Beerbungs</span> are irrevocably
kicked out of the house, they
comfort themselves by squabbling with one another, and talking as if the
question was which had a right to the fixtures. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>,
 the bankrupt, is
dead, but has left a lot of sons, not bad fellows, but with very little
brains among them. And there is a cousin of their's, who at present
calls himself <span class="smcap">Shambore</span> (but I am told is a
real bore to any one who has
to spend the evening with him), and he comes from the elder branch of
the <span class="smcap">Beerbungs</span>, and claims to be the head of
the family. <span class="smcap">Shambore</span> and
<span class="smcap">Smith's</span> boys have hitherto been at daggers
drawn, and making everybody
laugh at their absurd quarrels. <span class="smcap">Shambore</span> has
settled just outside the
parish, and is always sticking up placards, some of them very profane,
abusing <span class="smcap">Loo</span>, or anybody who happened for the
time to have the 'King's
Head.' He lives at a place called Frowsy Wharf, and behaves as stuck-up
as if the parish belonged to him; sees people with his hat on; and has
got a long story about some miraculous hair oil which he says will never
dry off his head. Some think he is cracked. The <span class="smcap">Smith</span>
 boys used to make
all sorts of game of him, and call him '<span class="smcap">Fatty</span>,'
 and, when their father
had the house, they used to stone any one who went to see him.</p>

<p>"But somehow, <span class="smcap">Shambore</span> and the <span
class="smcap">Smiths</span> have made it up. Why, nobody
knows; but it is thought that the tallow-monger has been at them, and
has promised to stand something handsome if they will unite to bring
actions of trespass against <span class="smcap">Loo</span>. However, be
this as it may last week
down comes one of <span class="smcap">Smith's</span> sons&#8212;who calls
himself (for they have all
<i>aliases</i>) <span class="smcap">Knee Moore</span>&#8212;to Frowsy Wharf,
in his best clothes, and all
being arranged, knocks three knocks&#8212;no more nor less&#8212;at <span
class="smcap">Shambore's</span>
front door. He would not knock two knocks, for fear of being thought a
postman; and <span class="smcap">Shambore</span> would not let him knock
 four, because that would
be coming the swell too much. <span class="smcap">Shambore</span> was
peeping over the blind (which
had crochet lilies on it), but of course <span class="smcap">Moore</span>
 pretended not to see him.
The maid opened the door, and <span class="smcap">Moore</span> asked if <span
 class="smcap">Mr. Shambore</span> was in. 'What
name, Sir?' says the girl. But <span class="smcap">Shambore</span> had
bolted through the back
parlour, and was standing on the stairs. 'What do I see?' he shouts out.
'Come in by all means;' and he comes down exactly four stairs&#8212;no
more&#8212;and waits for the other. <span class="smcap">Moore</span> will not
take off his hat until the
door is shut, for fear the neighbours should think he's nobody, but he
hangs it on a peg, and makes <span class="smcap">Shambore</span> a bow.</p>

<p>"'I am glad to call on the head of my family,' says <span
class="smcap">Moore</span>, kicking out
his leg behind, and making the girl laugh. <span class="smcap">Shambore</span>
 makes him say it
again, pretending to be deaf. Then they shake hands, and the girl is
sent out for beer, and they sit down and drink bad luck to <span
class="smcap">Unlimited
Loo</span>, and may he soon lose his licence. And it seems they have
arranged
that, if they can kick <span class="smcap">Loo</span> out, and get the
house, <span class="smcap">Shambore's</span> to keep it
for the good of the family, until a boy&#8212;a son of <span class="smcap">Moore's</span>
 elder
brother&#8212;is old enough to take the licence; and, to prevent danger, if
<span class="smcap">Shambore's</span> wife dies he is not to marry
again. The precious couple sat a

<h4>Two Great Questions.</h4>

<p>There are two great questions which at present address themselves to
the
political mind, and they are both in connexion with wages. Without
entering into the merits of either, we may say that in England the great
question is, "How wages are?" and in Turkey, "How wages war?"</p>

<hr />

<h4>LOVE IN LOW LIFE.</h4>

<p>Whether much love prevails on both sides between husband and wife
among
the inferior classes, properly so called, of this country, may be
questioned, but there is no doubt that the wives, at least, are much
smitten.</p>

<hr />

<h4>THE PORTE IN BOTTLE.</h4>

<p>If Turkey can be enabled to hold her own a few years longer, she
will,
there are good reasons for hoping, arrive at a high state of
civilization. There is little doubt that the Ottoman Porte will improve
by keeping.</p>

<h2>ST. CECILIA AND ST. HELEN.</h2>

<center>Touching the subjoined newspaper advertisement:&#8212;</center>

<blockquote><p>ORGANIST.&#8212;A VACANCY IN THE APPOINTMENT of ORGANIST for
the parish
of St. Helen, Bishopsgate, London, having been created by the death
of Dr. Bexfield, candidates for the office are requested to forward
their letters of application and testimonials on or before the 23rd
day of November instant, addressed to <span class="smcap">Mr.
Churchwarden Richardson</span>,
2, Great St. Helen's, London, by whom all inquiries as to the duties
and salary will be answered.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Mr. Punch</i> begs to ask <span class="smcap">Mr. Churchwarden
Richardson</span> a question. Would
<span class="smcap">Cecilia Punch</span> be eligible for the vacant
situation of organist to St.
Helen's parish? For <i>Mr. Punch</i> has heard that it is the practice
of
many vestries to exclude female candidates from competition for the
organist's office. Need <span class="smcap">Cecilia</span> apply? Has it
 been, by the parochial
powers,</p>

<blockquote><p>"Resolved, that female candidates be excluded."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecilia</span> would be thankful to be spared the
 anxiety and trouble of making
an application, in doubt whether or not it has been predestined to be
fruitless. One would think that the church of a female saint would admit
a female musician&#8212;or can it be that <span class="smcap">St. Helen</span>
 would have closed her
doors against her sainted sister, the namesake of <i>Miss Punch</i>,
herself?</p>

<p>To multiply, not to diminish, the means of honourable maintenance for
women ought to be the object of all Churchwardens and Vestries; as it
certainly is the interest of all rate-payers.</p>

<h4>Russian Honesty.</h4>

<p>There is a rigid sense of honesty in the Russian army. Lately, a
sergeant-major was flogged for stealing beyond his rank. There is a
graduated right of theft throughout all Russia. Thus, while a mere
master-shipwright may steal some cartloads of oak, a Lord of the
Admiralty may pocket a whole seventy-four. The god of Russia is not, in

<h2>THE MANCHESTER SCHOOL OF POETRY.</h2>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/221.png" alt="A" class="cap" width="30%" />
<p class="cap_3">A very pleasing advertisement appeared lately in the <i>Manchester
Advertiser</i>, an advertisement which all who are interested in
literature
will be glad to see. Here it is:&#8212;</p>
</div>

<blockquote><p>WANTED, A POET.&#8212;A tradesman who wishes to advertise his
wares
extensively, wants a Gentleman who can Write Advertising Poetical
Effusions with facility.&#8212;Apply by letter, containing specimens of
poetry, to A S, at the Printer's.</p></blockquote>

<p>Though poor <span class="smcap">Johnson</span> or <span class="smcap">Goldsmith</span>
 would have been glad of such an offer,
some conceited brethren of the goose-quill may look with contempt at the
idea of the application of poetry to the advertisement of wares. Why not
apply poetry to the advertisement of wares as well as apply Art to their
construction? is not Art-crockery considered a great thing?&#8212;and what is
your School of Design for, but to supply us with Art-clothes and
Art-furniture; so that in good time we shall have Art-velvets,
Art-cottons, Art-muslins, Art-silks, and Art-satins, for Art-waistcoats,
Art-shirt-fronts, Art-frocks, Art-slips, Art-gowns; likewise Art-chairs
and Art-tables, Art-fenders, Art-fire-irons, Art-pots and Art-kettles,
Art-coalscuttles, Art-paper for walls, Art-bell-pulls, Art-pump-handles,
Art bedsteads, and Art-washhand basins? The spirit of the age requires
that Art shall be turned to practical account. He that would prosper by
the poetical Art must utilise it. One way to do so, as good as any
other, would be to sing the praises of candlesticks, for instance, or
knives and forks, or haberdashery, or any other description of goods;
what not? Poets have quite exhausted their old stock of subjects; they
want a new stock, and that of a linendraper would be as good as any. The
lines&#8212;</p>

<div class="poem1"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">O heavenly Muse! the vast assortment sing,</p>
<p class="i0">Of <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>, <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>,
 <span class="smcap">Wilkinson</span> and <span class="smcap">King</span>,</p>
</div></div>

<p>for example, might serve for the commencement, and indicate the
argument
of a modern Epic of the Manchester School. The place of the hero in the
poem would of course be supplied by a power-loom. But the "poetical
effusions" required as per advertisement would necessarily be lyrical.
Here an abundance of themes opens up to the bard. Suppose that the wares
which the poet is engaged to advertise are stuffs. It will not follow
that his verses should be stuff too. Leaving doggrel to the minstrel of
<span class="smcap">Moses</span>, he might aim at a really sentimental
treatment of his subject. He
might, with the view of calling public attention to a silk, write
something of this sort:&#8212;</p>

<h4>LINES TO ISABEL.</h4>

<div class="poem1"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">I saw thee dancing in the hall;</p>
<p class="i2">The beauteous robe that draped thy form</p>
<p class="i0">Had just the free and flowing fall</p>
<p class="i2">Of some old statue's; but, too warm,</p>
<p class="i0">Too glowing were that eye and cheek,</p>
<p class="i2">To let thy shape of loveliness</p>
<p class="i0">Like marble seem, though rarest Greek,</p>
<p class="i2">For all that chaste and graceful dress!</p>

and Striking Novelty.
Now Selling Off at a Tremendous Sacrifice</i>. <span class="smcap">Jackson
 and Co.</span>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The foregoing is merely an attempt to show what might be done in this
line, or sort of lines. It is no easy job, as a judicious ancient
observes, to do common themes to a T.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is strange, however, that a Manchester tradesman should
have
to advertise for a poet. Is there no young man in his establishment that
turns down his collars and grows his hair in ringlets, and has joined
the moustache-movement, that would answer his purpose? In most large
businesses there are such young men, who let off their poetical steam in
effusions to the moon, &amp;c., and merely waste it. Many of these poor
young fellows are snubbed and ridiculed, and thus have their
self-regard&#8212;which is always sensitive&#8212;irritated and mortified, till
they are driven to all manner of reckless and evil courses; whereas, by
the useful direction of their talent, rendering it subservient to the
purposes of the shop, they would be enabled to fulfil the aspirations
that are in them with credit to themselves and with advantage to their
employers: provided they would pay that attention to their grammatical
studies, which is necessary to the composition of decent verses, even on
the subject of a merino or a ducape.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="smcap">The Real and the Ideal.</span>&#8212;There is as much
difference between the real
and the ideal, as there is between a castle in Ayrshire and a castle in
the Air.</p>

<hr />

<h2>THE EXPENSE OF MAKING A BARON.</h2>

<p>Those who accept dignities are usually expected to pay for them; but,
perhaps, if a man has "greatness thrust upon him" in the form of a
title, it would be rather hard to make him pay £420 for an "honour" of
which he was not solicitous. Before a man can be "dubbed" a knight he
must "dub up" some £200; but it seems to cost between £400 and £500 to
make a baron. Last year <span class="smcap">Lord Fitzroy Somerset</span>
 was changed into <span class="smcap">Lord
Raglan</span>&#8212;a conversion which, though it might have been managed as
easily
and as cheaply as the pantomime trick of <span class="smcap">So-and-So</span>
 <i>afterwards</i>
<span class="smcap">Harlequin</span>, or <span class="smcap">Pantaloon</span>,
 or <span class="smcap">Clown</span>, has, it seems, added upwards of
£400
to the annual item of civil contingencies. It is very "civil," no doubt,
to make a commoner into a peer, but when the "contingency" arrives, we
think the recipient of the honour ought to be civilly expected to pay
for it. Perhaps, however, the better course would be to do it cheap, and
we should hardly think the dignity of the peerage can be sustained by
such charges as we find making up the sum total of the cost of a Barony.</p>

<p>The Clerk of the Hanaper, or Hamper, gets £24 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>;
 but why the
title of Baron should be hampered with such an expense it is difficult
to guess, unless it is that the newly-made peer is expected to "wet" his
dignity with a few dozen of something drinkable. Deputy Hamper&#8212;by
virtue, possibly, of some bottled beer&#8212;gets a guinea; and the "porter
to the Great Seal" has another guinea; but, whether the word "porter"
applies to some officers, or to some beer for the <span class="smcap">Lord
 Chancellor's</span>
department, we have no means of knowing. The sealing of the patent is a
costly affair, including "Sealer, £1 2<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>; Deputy
ditto, 10<i>s.</i>
6<i>d.</i>; Chaff Wax, £1 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; deputy ditto, 10<i>s.</i>
 6<i>d.</i>"; from
which we can only infer that, while two officers are employed in the act
of sealing, two other officers are standing by and "chaffing" the
operation.</p>

<p>The "Royal Household" receives £104 6<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i> for a
jollification, no
doubt; though we suspect that this act of <i>High Life Below Stairs</i>
in
the Palace is entirely without the sanction of Royalty. Our old friend
"Garter" comes in for £20, which is moderate, considering how invariably
the recipients of dignities are tied by the leg by Garter's stringent
requirements. The bill winds up with one guinea for the engrossing
clerk, who engrosses very little of the profit but a great deal of the
trouble, for he was obliged to engross the warrant and find the
parchment.</p>

<p>It costs in all £420 to make a Peer; and if every Member of the
Peerage
is worth what he costs, it is easy to estimate the value of the Upper
House of Parliament. Our own opinion is, that the Lords would be quite
as precious without the preliminary outlay incurred in their
manufacture; but if something is to be paid on the occasion, we think
the money might be better employed than by inciting it in chaff, or any
other kind of wax, and liquidating it in "porter," or Hampers of any
description whatever.</p>

<hr />

<h4>A Tap on a Tub.</h4>

<p>The <i>Morning Advertiser</i>, speaking of <span class="smcap">Louis
Napoleon's</span> new tariff
reforms, says that he has effected them, "<i>deaf</i> to the howlings of
 the
iron-masters <i>and the scowlings of the coal-owners</i>". One would not
deprive the <span class="smcap">Emperor</span> of one iota of his merit,
 but we have a "random
recollection" that a "scowl" is a thing to see, rather than to hear. We
do think that our friends the Licensed Victuallers are entitled to
demand better grammar for their money. <i>Our</i> <span class="smcap">Jeames</span>
 would not have so
written.</p>

<h2>THE TURTLE BENEVOLENT ASSOCIATION</h2>

<h4><small>FOR</small></h4>

<h4>THE RELIEF OF DESTITUTE ALDERMEN.</h4>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 25%;">
<a href="images/222a.png">
<img src="images/222a.png" alt="Man reading Aldermanic scroll"
width="100%" /></a>
</div>

<p>We are glad to inform our readers that a Society, with the above
benevolent motive, is in the course of formation. We need not say that,
in the state of extreme destitution to which the poor Aldermen are
likely, in another year, to be reduced, such a society, like every other
society that has hitherto been started, will supply a great vacuum. The
use of Turtle to an Alderman has become a sort of second nature; and
when, by circumstances over which&#8212;unlike the City Funds&#8212;he has had no
control, he is deprived of that great humanising and aldermanising
necessity, we need not say that a very great vacuum will be created in
his stomach. It is to fill that vacuum&#8212;which, if filled by the
Alderman's own resources, would cause a vacuum in his pocket as great as
the one that already exists in his mind&#8212;that a few charitable
individuals have joined together in sympathy and guineas to relieve the
wants of a large luxurious class of their fellow-countrymen.</p>

<p>Until the prospectus, in due satin paper and gilt-edge form, is
issued,
we beg to dot down a few of the principal features of this benevolent
association:&#8212;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prince Albert</span> is to be President of this
new charity, if he will only
accept it, in return for the statue which the Aldermen have been trying
to get up in his honour, in the hope that they may be represented on the
pedestal in some humble capacity&#8212;either as hanging on to his Royal
Highness's coat-tails, or else kissing his princely boots.</p>

<p>Committees will be appointed to visit the different Wards, and some
of
the highest ladies in the land have been most eager in applying for this
charitable office.</p>

<p>Aldermen who have passed the chair will be allowed their three basins
 of
Turtle a week. Those, who have not yet come to that awful pass, will
only receive their one basin, of the usual size of those which a person
pays five shillings for at <span class="smcap">Birch's</span>.</p>

<p>On the 9th of November&#8212;the anniversary of the grand <span
class="smcap">Lord Mayor's</span>
Day&#8212;the whole body of Aldermen are to be allowed, in addition to their
Turtle, a small glass of iced Punch.</p>

<p>A select number, also, will be taken in rotation, and given a ride in
glass-coaches, that will be directed to follow the precise route that
the <span class="smcap">Lord Mayor's</span> procession was in the habit
of taking every memorable
9th of November. Pocket handkerchiefs will be provided gratuitously, to
stem the grief of such Aldermen for whom the sight may be too much.</p>

<p>Negotiations are in treaty for the Mansion House, which will be
unoccupied as soon as the City Corporation has died its unnatural death.
It is expected to be vacant in a year. A better locality could not
possibly be chosen, on account of the number of pleasant associations
that are connected with that building, which was so proverbially
hospitable with other people's money.</p>

<p>Those Aldermen who are prevented, by illness or modesty, from
applying
at the Mansion House, will be relieved at their own mansions.</p>

<p>All Aldermen will be expected to bring their own basins and spoons.</p>

<p>Any Alderman convicted of bringing up his basin to be filled a second
time on the same day, will be denied any further relief for an entire
twelvemonth.</p>

<p>The tickets, under any circumstances, are not to be sold; but it is
hoped, in the event of the expected success of the Association, that
measures will be taken to add venison to the Turtle.</p>

<p>Further particulars will be shortly published, with a list of the
bankers and houses where subscriptions are to be paid, and where the
smallest contributions, in the way of turtle or venison, will be
thankfully received.</p>

<p>A smaller Charity will also be established&#8212;at least the attempt will
be
made&#8212;in connection with the parent one. Its object will be to relieve
the Common Councilmen with Mock Turtle.</p>

<p>It is a source of great consolation, to think that these poor
miserable
creatures, when they are turned out of their comfortable quarters, will
not be totally unprovided for in their old age. Ruin, it is true, is
staring them in the face; but still their few declining years may be
rendered comparatively happy, by their being still supplied with those
comforts which the custom of a whole life has turned into nothing less
than positive wants. To prove we bear no malice towards those who are
fallen, we wish every success to these "<span class="smcap">Turtle Soup
Kitchens for
Destitute Aldermen</span>;" and, as soon as the casseroles are got into
boiling
order, we are ready to pay our first subscription.</p>

<hr />

<h2>SHORTCOMING OF THE CITY.</h2>

<p>The City of London is not quite <span class="smcap">Plato's</span>
Model Republic. It has not
completely realized its idea of corporate perfection. Not permitting the
subjects of its jurisdiction to measure or to carry their own
commodities, it has established corn, coal, fruit, and oyster-meters,
and fellowship-porters, whom it obliges them to employ on terms
prescribed by itself. But it does not carry out the principle of
preventing individuals from managing their own affairs, by prohibiting
them from doing anything whatever for themselves, which it is possible
that somebody else may do for them. It has not established Civic
Barbers, empowered to shave all men who reside within its precincts,
whether willing or unwilling to submit their chins to those officers,
and it does not deny anybody the right of shaving himself.</p>

friend of <span class="smcap">M. Mazzini</span>, and which concluded
thus:&#8212;</p>
</div>

<blockquote><p>"Revolution was called disorder. It might be so, but the
only way to
finish with disorder was to make revolution.&#8212;(<i>Cheers.</i>) Therefore
it was that he wished for revolution, though its permanent success
involved the sad necessity of the guillotine." (<i>Great cheering.</i>)</p></blockquote>

<p>These daring words were uttered, not in the slummish purlieus of the
Square of Leicester, but at the splendid Rooms of that of Hanover. How
proud and glad we ought to feel of our freedom of utterance, considering
that at a place of fashionable resort, in an aristocratic neighbourhood,
an individual is permitted to speak out thus: declaring himself boldly
on the side of revolution and the guillotine!</p>

<p>Nevertheless, for the cause of European liberty, it is a pity that
this
gentleman had not either had his mouth stopped by the spontaneous action
of the muscles which serve to close that orifice, or shut up by cries of
"No, no!" substituted for the "great cheering" which greeted his avowal
in regard to revolutionism and decapitation. The use and applause of
such language must estrange all friends of freedom except those who are
mad. The exiles that indulge in it ought not, perhaps, to be deprived of
an asylum, but they ought to be restricted to one in which they can be
looked after. It is bad enough when patriots are consigned to the halter
by despots, but it is worse when, having rope given them, they use it to
hang themselves. The <span class="smcap">Emperors of Russia</span> and <span
 class="smcap">Austria</span> are much obliged to
those who talk like this foreign gentleman. The revolution contemplated
by <span class="smcap">M. Mazzini</span> is another thing, we hope, than
 that which is advocated by
his indiscreet friend, and to "make" which will, in truth, be a certain
"way to finish with disorder."</p>

<h2>TABLE TURNING AND TRUE PIETY.</h2>

<p>A Clergyman, the <span class="smcap">Rev. R. W. Dibdin</span>, M.A.,
has published a Lecture
recently delivered by him at the Music Hall, Store Street, upon Table
Turning, which he ascribes to "Satanic Agency," animadverting on all who
differ with him on the subject; among others, on ourselves. Referring to
this periodical he is pleased to say,</p>

<blockquote><p>"I will only remark that it is conspicuous (like the <i>Times</i>
newspaper, which it echoes), for its <i>consistent enmity to true
piety</i>;&#8212;its advocacy of Sabbath desecration in the Sydenham
Exhibition, and the Sunday delivery of letters by the Post Office.
And I very much wonder that religious people support it as they do."</p></blockquote>

<p>If any newspaper discusses the questions of the day generally in a
spirit of common sense, and this periodical treats them in the same
spirit, there must be a general coincidence of opinion between this
periodical and that newspaper, which <span class="smcap">Mr. Dibdin</span>
 may call an echo if he
pleases. But he has no right to term <i>Punch</i> a consistent enemy to
true
piety, because we do not admit that a Christian is bound to keep Sunday
as a Jew is obliged to observe Saturday. And his wonder that religious
people support <i>Punch</i> as they do may be abated by the
consideration
that religion is not, in all people, allied with superstition, or with
cant and hypocrisy. Religion <i>Punch</i> has always held, and hopes to
hold,
inviolate; but the pretence of it, whether designed to restrict his
liberty, or impose upon his understanding, he has ever denounced and
ever will denounce. Withhold from the child the letter of the sick
parent; deny the fagged artisan his breath of fresh air and half-holyday
once a week, under a religious pretext, and <i>Punch</i> will protest
you a
Pharisee, and tell you that you might as well forbid him to extricate an
ox, or a <span class="smcap">Mr. Dibdin</span>, from a pit into which,
he might happen to tumble on
the Sabbath day. And if lies or delusions are propounded to his
credence, tales, whether of table-talking or picture-working, <i>Punch</i>
will not be hindered from laughing at them by the circumstance that they
are preached beneath the cover of religion.</p>

<p><i>Punch</i> never knowingly admits anything into his pages that
could shock
the feelings of religious people. For that reason he forbears to quote
from <span class="smcap">Mr. Dibdin's</span> pamphlet an assertion that <span
 class="smcap">Mr. Dibdin</span> professes to
quote from the devil; a piece of blasphemy too frightfully shocking to
be repeated. The following, however, may be cited as specimens of the
answers elicited by the Rev. gentleman and a <span class="smcap">Mr. B.</span>
 from a small,
square, three-legged table on casters, by lying their hands on it:&#8212;</p>

<blockquote><p>"1. If there be a <span class="smcap">God</span>,
strike three with the leg next the
fire-place.&#8212;That leg was raised, and struck thrice.</p>

<p>"2. If there be a devil, strike so many times with this
leg.&#8212;It did
so.</p>

<p>"3. If the <span class="smcap">Pope</span> be the head of the
Church, strike, &amp;c.&#8212;It did so.</p>

<p>"4. If <span class="smcap">Martin Luther</span> was a good
man, strike, &amp;c.&#8212;No reply.</p>

<p>"5. If <span class="smcap">Emanuel Swedenborg</span> was a
good man, strike, &amp;c.&#8212;It did so.</p>

<p>"6. If <span class="smcap">Socinius</span> was a good man,
strike, &amp;c.&#8212;It did so.</p>

<p>"7. If <span class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span> be come in the
flesh, strike, &amp;c.&#8212;It did so.</p>

<p>"8. If salvation be of faith and works, strike, &amp;c.&#8212;It did
 so.</p>

<p>"9. If salvation be by faith alone, strike, &amp;c.&#8212;It did so.</p>

<p>"10. If <span class="smcap">Dr. Achilli</span> be a good man,
strike, &amp;c.&#8212;No reply.</p>

<p>"11. If <span class="smcap">Dr. Achilli</span> be turned
Swedenborgeon, strike, &amp;c.&#8212;It did so.</p>

<p>"12. If <span class="smcap">Dr. Newman</span> be a good man,
strike, &amp;c.&#8212;It did so (very
quickly).</p>

<p>"13. If <span class="smcap">Mr. Tonna</span> be a good man,
stop moving.&#8212;It continued moving.</p>

<p>"14. Strike the day of the month&#8212;It struck twenty-eight.</p>

<p>"15. Strike the hour.&#8212;It struck seven and a gentle lift of the
 leg.
[It was half-past seven].</p>

<p>"16. If it be right to go to a Socinian Chapel, strike,
&amp;c.&#8212;It did
so.</p>

<p>"17. If it be right to go to the theatre, strike, &amp;c.&#8212;It
did so.</p>

<p>"18. Say how many years it is since <span class="smcap">Her
Majesty</span> came to the throne.</p>

<p>"No one present knew the date of her accession. I may here
say, that
I asked several questions on this principle, upon facts with which
none of us were acquainted.</p>

<p>"It struck sixteen.</p>

<p>"None of us could tell whether this was right or not, and,
therefore, one of the party left the room to fetch an almanack, and
when we had got the almanack we found that it was right."</p></blockquote>

<p>Other ages were given by the table, according to the Reverend
experimenter; it also stopped when the Bible was placed upon it, like
the similarly possessed moveables of <span class="smcap">Messrs. Godfrey</span>
 and <span class="smcap">Gillson</span>. At
least so he would have us believe, or be accounted altogether
unbelieving. For he declares of Table Turning, that</p>

<blockquote><p>"Those who have not witnessed its wonders, and disbelieve
 (or
attempt to explain away) the statements of those who <i>have</i>, must
be
passed by as impracticable subjects, acting precisely on the
principle of the infidel <span class="smcap">Hume</span>, who, because
he never saw a miracle,
would have us infer that no one else ever did."</p></blockquote>

<p>This is precisely the style in which Roman Catholic priests argue in
behalf of miraculous images, and if <span class="smcap">Mr. Dibdin</span>
 did not profess a vast
abhorrence of Popery, he might be imagined to be one of the clerical
correspondents of the <i>Tablet</i>. In another place he says,</p>

<blockquote><p>"If any one doubts my <i>veracity</i>, or questions the <i>possibility
 of
my senses being correct witnesses</i>&#8212;in such a case I have nothing to
reply to that person. Such an one puts himself out of the reach of
argument; and by such incredulity makes it impossible to prove
anything to him."</p></blockquote>

<p>We are called upon to admit the infallibility of <span class="smcap">Mr.
 Dibdin's</span> senses, as
well as his good faith, although we have the opposing testimony of
<span class="smcap">Faraday</span>, and although, whilst Table Turning
is, as <span class="smcap">Mr. Dibdin</span> himself
says, practised daily by tens of thousands, there has been no one
satisfactory exhibition of the wonder in public. <i>Punch</i> has tried
Table
and Hat Turning. The hat and the table gave signs of beginning to turn;
which ceased, not at his command to stop, but on his reminding the rest
of the party that they were not to push.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor Faraday</span>, by the way, fares very
badly at the hands of <span class="smcap">Mr.
Dibdin</span>, who not only insinuates a doubt respecting the "spiritual
attainments" of that philosopher, but also uniformly spells his name
with two R's. He has also as above, <span class="smcap">Socinius</span>
for <span class="smcap">Socinus</span>, and for
Swedenborgian, Swedenborgeon. Perhaps he has derived his orthography
from tables, which he mentions as having been found to spell badly;
indeed, trustworthy as tables are esteemed in matters of arithmetic,
they have never been accounted authorities in regard to spelling.</p>

<p>But <span class="smcap">Mr. Dibdin</span> is not to be laughed
at&#8212;although he may himself hold up
other people to something less innocent than ridicule. He observes that</p>

<blockquote><p>"It may seem very wise and great to laugh down a weak
brother; but
surely it is neither kind nor brotherly."</p></blockquote>

<p>Nevertheless, it is not easy to repress a risible emotion when we
picture to ourselves a party of weak brethren sitting round a table to
see if they can get the devil into it. <span class="smcap">Mr. Dibdin</span>
 says it is necessary
to keep the hands on the table. Does the evil spirit, then, flow out of
the fingers' ends into the mahogany? and does <span class="smcap">Mr.
Dibdin</span> think that he
has acted as the devil's conductor? We shall next have Calvinistic
clergymen making pump-handles work, and turning mangles to the same
account as tables, by Satanic action.</p>

<p>However, it is certain that the dreadful nonsense in the book before
us
was rapped out <i>either</i> by the devil, <i>or</i> by <span
class="smcap">Mr. Dibdin</span>, or his
friends. If we had any doubt on the subject, we should give them the
benefit of the doubt; but we are afraid that none can be reasonably
entertained.</p>

<h2>HUMAN COPYING MACHINES.</h2>

<p>Everybody says the law has gone to ruin, and if this is the case, we
can
only say that the law has gone where it has brought so many&#8212;or in other
words, that the lawyers have followed their clients. The "profession"
must certainly be at a low ebb when it is reduced to the degradation of
issuing such advertisements as the following, which has been sent up to
us by several Correspondents, who have cut it out from a Birmingham
newspaper.</p>

<blockquote><p>WANTED, immediately, in a Country Solicitor's Office, a
WRITING
CLERK. He must understand Abstracting, Engrossing, and Accounts.
Salary about 13<i>s</i>. a week. Unexceptionable references must be
given.&#8212;Apply to&#8212;&#8212;, Solicitor, Birmingham.</p></blockquote>

<p>We have been told that "necessity has no law;" but it would seem that
the law is reduced to the last stage of necessity, or it would never
offer such beggarly terms as those specified above to the very meanest
of its myrmidons. "Thirteen shillings a week" is about one-third of the
pay of a journeyman carpenter, and less than a third of what may be
earned by many of those who are out "on strike" for higher wages. The
poor wretch who is offered thirteen shillings a week must, it seems,
understand "abstracting;" but we should fear that he might try his
abilities in endeavouring to "abstract" something from the cash-box of
his principal. It is evident that the lawyers, having been curtailed of
their power to fleece the public, are determined to take it out of their
unfortunate clerks, and if blood can be got out of a stone, an attorney
is just the man to perform the operation.</p>

<hr />

<p>A MUFF DROPPED, by a young Lady, on Wednesday last, in the Regent's
Park, between the Botanical and Zoological Gardens. It is rather rich in
appearance, but extremely heavy; has very long hair, and nothing
whatever inside. Any one, falling in with the above, is perfectly
welcome to the acquisition, as the Muff became such a dead weight,
continually hanging about, and wanting to be carried everywhere, that
the Young Lady, not being able to bear it any longer, was really
compelled to drop it. The Muff may be known at any time by its having
red hair, and answering to the name of <span class="smcap">Charles</span>.</p>

<hr />

<h2>THE REASON OF PRISON EXPENDITURE.</h2>

<p>The following paragraph occurs in the <i>Preston Guardian</i>:&#8212;</p>

<blockquote><p>"<span class="smcap">The Cost of Crime.</span>&#8212;The <span
class="smcap">Reverend Mr. Clay</span>, the Chaplain of the
Preston House of Correction, estimates the loss caused to the public
by fifteen pickpockets, whose careers he has traced, including the
value of the property stolen, expenses of prosecution, and
maintenance in gaol, at £26,500."</p></blockquote>

<p>How many schoolmasters might have been had for the money which
fifteen
pickpockets have cost the nation?&#8212;and how many more than fifteen boys
might those schoolmasters have prevented from becoming pickpockets?&#8212;and
how much larger a sum than £26,500 would have thereby been saved?</p>

<p>Why cannot this great saving of money&#8212;to say nothing of vice and
misery&#8212;be effected?</p>

<p>Simply because Papists and Protestants, High Church, Low Church, and
Dissenters, cannot agree as to which of them shall have the privilege of
preoccupying the minds of street-children with ideas about which bishops
and doctors differ!</p>

<h4>Love.</h4>

<center>(<i>A Prose Definition by</i> <span class="smcap">Moses'</span> <i>Poet</i>.)</center>

<p>Love comes from Courtship, and Courtship is a suit that is not made
in a
day. It is the slow result of several measures, and these measures
cannot be taken too carefully; but Love at first sight is a ready-made
suit that is entered into at once, and for which, as the result
frequently proves, neither party was in the least fitted.</p>

<h4>SCOTLAND HUMILIATED.</h4>

<p>Tuesday the 29th of November, 1853, was celebrated as a day of
humiliation in Edinburgh; and the humiliation consisted in making the
day as much like a Scotch Sunday as possible. Recollecting as we do:
1st, That there is more drunkenness in Scotland than anywhere else in
the United Kingdom; 2ndly, That there is more drunkenness on Sunday in
Scotland than on any other day; and, 3rdly, That the day of humiliation
was a close resemblance to a Scotch Sunday;&#8212;we may draw the inference
that the "humiliation" must have been complete. We have no doubt the
number of those that were either moved by the spirit, or kept from the
power of moving by the spirit, must have been enormous, on the occasion
alluded to.</p>

<h2>A PLAN FOR THE SIMPLIFICATION OF PUBLIC ORATORY.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Punch</span>, who has suffered so much from
the inordinate long-windedness
of our public orators in general, and of our senators in particular,
that he can thoroughly appreciate the misery which it must have
inflicted upon the nation, has, of his own free motion and consent,
meditated and devised a scheme, by which the nation will be released
from the pain of hearing, and our public men from the labour of uttering
speeches; whilst the former will still have the conviction that its
representatives are taking pains to express its sentiments, and the
latter will still have their vanity gratified by the belief that they
are making a sensation. <i>Mr. Punch</i> has read in the works of <span
class="smcap">Messrs. Huc</span>
and <span class="smcap">Gabet</span> (two missionaries, in whom the
humour of <span class="smcap">Rabelais</span> is combined
with the kindly fervour of <span class="smcap">Las Casas</span>) that
the Lamas in Thibet&#8212;who have
more prayers to recite than they can get through in a day, without
suspending their ordinary avocations&#8212;are in the habit of employing what
they call Tchu Kor, or turning prayers. These are large but light
cylinders of wood, placed on an axle, and inscribed with a great number
of prayers in Thibetian characters. The devout Lama gives the Tchu Kor a
push, which sets it in motion for a considerable period, during which he
goes about his secular business, and leaves the performance of his
religious exercises to this pious whirligig.</p>

<p>If <i>Mr. Punch</i> were acquainted with the Lamas, he would suggest
to them
that by the help of a little simple machinery and the aid of a turnspit
dog, they might prolong their prayers for a period quite beyond the
strength of their own ingenious but imperfect instrument. But as it is,
he contents himself with recommending that Tchu Kor, or talking
cylinders, shall be introduced into the House of Commons without delay.
So many of the speeches made in that assembly have no sort of interest
for it or for the public, and are dictated only by the desire of the
Members to acquit themselves of a duty to their constituents, that they
might as well not be uttered at all. And as no speech is supposed to
influence a division, or gain over a vote, whilst many give rise to much
bad blood, and to endless misunderstandings, prevarications, rejoinders,
and recriminations, it would be as well that so fertile a source of
mischief should at once be dried up; and that if Members must talk, they
should do so only through the medium of the Tchu Kor.</p>

<p>Each Member might have his peculiar cylinder, surmounted by a bust of
himself, and carved from that tree, whose properties were most in
accordance with the characteristics of his oratory or his politics. Thus
the cylinders of <span class="smcap">Lord Brougham</span> and <span
class="smcap">Mr. Disraeli</span>, that pungent couple,
might be carved from the prickly pear; those of <span class="smcap">Mr.
Newdegate</span> and <span class="smcap">Mr.
Henley</span> from the sloe; that of <span class="smcap">Mr. Hume</span>,
 the Senior of the House, from
the elder; that of <span class="smcap">Sir Robert Inglis</span>, from
the cherry, as he is the <span class="smcap">Bob</span>
<i>chéri</i> of the high Torics; that of <span class="smcap">Mr. Bright</span>,
 from the aspen; that of
<span class="smcap">Mr. Brotherton</span>, the Vegetarian, from a large
turnip; that of <span class="smcap">Mr. Lucas</span>,
from the bramble; that of <span class="smcap">Mr. Cobden</span>, from
the (good) service tree; and
that of <span class="smcap">Lord Palmerston</span>, the universal
favourite, from the poplar. (Oh!)</p>

<p>The members might attend to turn their own cylinders, or the "Turner
of
the House of Commons" (for the duties of the Speaker would be at an end)
might go round and set in motion the cylinders of those whose opinions
he wished to circulate. The Irish members might be gratified, yet
without any hindrance to public business, by the simultaneous gyrations
of all their cylinders; a number of others, inscribed with the words
Hear! Hear! or Question! might always be kept going; and if any
honourable gentlemen chose to inscribe on their Tchu Kor words
descriptive of cock-crowing or braying, they might make fowls or donkeys
of themselves without hurting the feelings of others. In short <i>Mr.
Punch</i> is so interested in his scheme, and so anxious for its
development, that he pledges himself to have <i>Toby</i> in readiness to
 turn
<span class="smcap">Lord John Russell's</span> Tchu Kor, on the very
first night that the scheme
shall come into operation</p>

<h2>AGRICULTURAL BRUISERS.</h2>

<p>Thrashing, bruising and milling are now carried to such perfection by
machinery that every housekeeper may thrash his own establishment, every
father of a family may do his own bruising, and every man may have the
luxury of a private mill on his own premises. At the recent Cattle Show,
our attention was invited to a "compact hand mill," calculated to do an
immense amount of bruising, and to give a regular good dressing at the
same time to a certain quantity of flour. The newspapers are continually
asking us whether we bruise our oats, and intimating that if we
vigorously assault our corn it will serve us as well again, from which
we infer that every blow administered to our oats will be the means of
an extra blow-out to our cattle. We wish our agricultural friends would
tell us whether the bruising system would be applicable to anything else
beside corn, and whether we may safely, in addition to bruising our
oats, give occasionally a black eye to a potatoe?</p>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/226.png" alt="T" class="cap" width="30%" />

<p class="cap_3">THE serious importance of Table Talking has been
recognised by the City
of London Corporation Commission, who have examined, as a witness, one
of the Mansion House tables. The answers which they obtained by its
means are important, as bearing on the question of Aldermanic agency.</p>
</div>

<p>No sooner had the Commissioners placed their hands on the table than
it
began to move, evidently not from any involuntary muscular action, for
to whatever extent those gentlemen pushed their inquiries, they did not
push the table.</p>

<p>The following interrogatories were then put to the table, which
rapped
out the corresponding replies in the usual manner by striking with one
of its legs, once for the affirmative, and twice for the negative, or
giving the floor a knock at each of the several letters required to form
a word, as the Chairman ran his pencil over the Alphabet:&#8212;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1. How old are you? The table rapped so many times that the
Commissioners were tired, and directed it to stop, which it did.</p>

<p>2. Are you older than the oldest inhabitant?&#8212;Yes.</p>

<p>3. Did you know <span class="smcap">Walworth</span>?&#8212;Intimately.</p>

<p>4. Was <span class="smcap">Whittington</span> a man or a
myth?&#8212;Both.</p>

<p>5. Was he <span class="smcap">Lord Mayor of London</span>?&#8212;Yes.</p>

<p>6. Three times?&#8212;Yes.</p>

<p>7. Used he and the Aldermen to dine together?&#8212;Sometimes.</p>

<p>8. What was the principal delicacy at their banquets?&#8212;Rapped
out "Ox."</p>

<p>9. Was it roasted?&#8212;Yes.</p>

<p>10. Whole?&#8212;Yes.</p>

<p>11. With a pudding in its belly?&#8212;Yes.</p>

<p>12. Was there venison pasty?&#8212;Yes.</p>

<p>13. Did a Member of the Corporation ever eat a whole one?&#8212;Yes.</p>

<p>14. Name the individual?&#8212;Spelt "<span class="smcap">Gog</span>."</p>

<p>15. Was he an Alderman?&#8212;Yes.</p>

<p>16. Who was <span class="smcap">Magog</span>?&#8212;Rapped "Mace."</p>

<p>17. Do you mean that he was Macebearer?&#8212;Yes.</p>

<p>18. For what was he celebrated?&#8212;Drink.</p>

<p>19. How much would he imbibe at a sitting?&#8212;Answered
"Hogsheads."</p>

<p>20. Of iced punch?&#8212;No. Of ale?&#8212;Yes. Of canary?&#8212;Yes. Of
Malvoisie?&#8212;Yes. Of each?&#8212;Yes.</p>

<p>21. Were statues erected to <span class="smcap">Gog</span> and
 <span class="smcap">Magog</span> to commemorate their
exploits?&#8212;Yes. In eating and drinking?&#8212;Yes.</p>

<p>22. Are you in suffering?&#8212;Yes.</p>

<p>23. From the effects of overloading?&#8212;Yes. From Gout?&#8212;Yes. In
one of
your legs?&#8212;Yes. Can you move that leg?&#8212;No.</p>

<p>24. Does the recollection of what you have had to bear disgust
 you?&#8212;The
table heaved violently.</p>

<p>25. Does conscience torment you?&#8212;Yes.</p>

<p>26. On account of the charities which you have served to
consume?&#8212;Yes.</p>

<p>27. Have you often groaned under your burdens?&#8212;Yes.</p>

<p>28. Give the number of tureens of real turtle which you have
borne in
your time.&#8212;Rapped to the number of twenty thousand, and was continuing,
when the time having arrived for the adjournment of the sitting, the
examination of the table was postponed to another day.</p>

<h2>FACTS FOR COCKNEY NATURALISTS.</h2>

<p>Setters are a kind of dog kept exclusively in poultry-yards, for the
purpose of assisting the hens in the work of incubation.</p>

<p>There are curious couples to be met with in the natural as well as in
the social world. Thus Rooks and Pigeons are almost always found in
company; while the Oyster but rarely appears without a Swallow.</p>

<p>The habits of the London rabbit (specimens of which may be obtained
at
any poulterer's) are extremely curious, and interesting to the
naturalist. Though wild at times, it is easily domesticated, and will
eat from the hand as well as from the pie-dish. It frequents in the
day-time the tops of water-tubs and the bottoms of areas: while at night
it is generally found on the tiles. When pleased, the animal makes a
soft purring noise; but at night its cries are loud and piercing, and
seriously disturb the neighbourhood which it infests. Its ears partake
rather of the "crop" order than the "lop," and unlike the country
species, it has a long tail. Unlike that species also, it is said, in
lodgings especially, to be omnivorous.</p>

<p>Salmon of large size may be caught pretty freely in the Serpentine
nearly all the year round&#8212;with a hook.</p>

<p>The author of "<i>Nasology</i>" asserts that human beings are
distinguished
chiefly by the nose; and the remark may be extended to the inferior
creation, for there is scarcely a creature but has some prominent
feature for the naturalist to lay hold of. Thus you may always know a
woodcock, like an inn keeper, by the length of his bill, while a
woodpecker more nearly resembles an apothecary, from its keeping bark
continually on tap. In the same way, too, cocks are distinguished by
their combs, and foxes by their brushes.</p>

<p>It is a singular fact that country cats have generally not half the
appetite of London ones. The voracity of these latter animals is indeed
prodigious; and hardly less surprising is the variety of their diet. We
have ourselves repeatedly known instances, where in a single night the
cat has been discovered to have eaten about a pound of beefsteak, and
more than three quarters of a leg of mutton; and we are informed by a
scientific friend of ours, who lives in lodgings, that he has even met
with cases well authenticated by his landlady, where in less than a week
her cat has consumed half a caddy of his tea, as well as an entire
bottle of his brandy.</p>

<h2>CENTRALIZATION IN THE CITY.</h2>

<p>Whatever may be the nature of the thinking principle of man, there is no
doubt that the soul of business, Punctuality, is material. This
psychological truth has been judiciously recognised in the practical
philosophy of the City of London, which has devised a method of insuring
the virtue in question, based on a profound conviction of its
materiality. Of Committees for General Purposes, <span class="smcap">Mr. Thomas Rogers</span>, in
evidence before the Corporation Commission, stated that</p>

<blockquote><p>"In order to induce Members to attend punctually the Chairman waits five
minutes. At the expiration of that time he drops his hammer, and then
all who are present have a right to dine with the Committee, but all who
come after the five minutes are excluded from the dinner."</p></blockquote>

<p>No doubt the attendance is generally full&#8212;at the commencement of the
proceedings as well as after the subsequent repast. But in case the
majority of the members are behind time, do the minority eat up the
dinner provided for the whole number? Should the persons present at the
fall of the hammer amount to just thirteen, does the popular
superstition, that objects to a baker's dozen at the mahogany, prevent
them from sitting down to table in a party of that number? If so, does
one gentleman retire, or is one more taken in from the excluded set, and
is the fortunate, or unfortunate, individual selected by lot? These are
questions that suggest themselves to most thinking minds, though they
did not occur to those of the Commissioners.</p>

<p>"<i>Domine Dirige Nos</i>" ought no longer to be the civic motto.
Considering
their characteristic principle of managing matters by appealing to the
centre of the human system, the stomach, a better motto for the
Corporation would be "<i>Medio tutissimus ibis</i>."</p>

<h2>PALMERSTON PERPLEXED.</h2>

<p>If the energetic Home Secretary had only mentioned to
us&#8212;confidentially
of course&#8212;that he contemplated inviting everybody who can use a
pen&#8212;every goose, in fact, possessed of a quill&#8212;to write to him on the
subject of any and every grievance, we should have dissuaded him from
the too adventurous act. The daily, and indeed hourly contents of our
letter-box would, if set before his Lordship, have convinced him, that
the corrector of public abuses will find himself continually buried
under a Mont Blanc of foolscap, and enveloped in a mist of envelopes.
<span class="smcap">Lord Palmerston</span> will have less labour thrown
upon him by his official
post, than the Penny Post will consign him to every hour of the day.</p>

<p>We, however, remind his Lordship to lay down a rule excluding all
anonymous letters from the number of those to which he is ready to give
attention. Already one enormous hoax has been played upon him by a wag,
who, under the signature of "<span class="smcap">Observer</span>," has
made a complaint against the
City Police of "charging the public with drawn swords" on Lord Mayor's
Day, and turning the Poultry into a sort of Peterloo. The Home Secretary
has already demanded an explanation from the civic authorities; but it
has turned out that the horses which rode over the people belonged to a
mare's nest, while the only charge upon the public by the City Police is
a charge of so much in the pound by way of rate, which is, no doubt,
rather a heavy one. We certainly acquit the police of the massacre
imputed to them by <span class="smcap">Lord Palmerston's</span>
anonymous friend, who seems to have
a little of the assassin in his own composition, for he does his utmost
to murder, by a stab in the dark, the characters of those whom he is too
cowardly to assail in a straightforward manner.</p>

<h2>CURIOSITIES OF THE CATTLE SHOW.</h2>

<p>The annual aggregation of "fatty deposits," at the Bazaar in Baker
Street, has just taken place as usual. It is, perhaps, as well that the
exhibition should be of brief duration; for, in these days of "nuisance
removal," we are not sure that the overfed beasts might not have been
regarded as so many accumulations of offensive matter, and ordered to be
got rid of accordingly.</p>

<p>The yearly gathering of agriculturists is, of course, the signal for
the
circulation of all sorts of puffing hand-bills setting forth the virtues
of some new inventions for puzzling the weak agricultural mind, and
making a demand on the agricultural pocket. We fancy we see a little
turn for irony in one of the announcements put into our hand, which
invited our "particular attention" to an article called the "Farmer's
Friend," which has proved "an efficacious cure of fret and cholic." If
the farmers have not yet left off fretting, here is a friend indeed; and
it is to be had as low as 1<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> a bottle. We should
suspect that
the proposed antidote to "fret and cholic" among the farmers would be
found, if analysed, to contain a good share of alcohol. Among the
"drinks for cattle" advertised at the Bazaar, we find one of a rather
startling description, which is recommended "for the disease called
Hoven Blown Blasted Fog sickness"&#8212;a malady which we hope neither man
nor beast is likely to be afflicted with.</p>

with a "Flirtation Polka." The gentleman probably conceives himself to
have a "mission" to diffuse the Evangel of <span class="smcap">Cupid</span>
 by the instrumentality
of capers.</p>

<h2>THE HERO OF A HUNDRED HURDLES.</h2>

<p>Two gallant officers, a Lieutenant and a Captain of the Fusileers,
have
lately been running a flat race and a hurdle race against each other.
The amusement was manly enough, and quite unobjectionable; though there
is something at the first glance rather odd in the idea of two British
officers competing which can run the fastest, when we recollect that
never to run is the usual practice of our soldiers. We are quite sure
that the competitors on this occasion will never use their running
powers in the field of action, except in pursuit of an enemy. The races
were well contested; the flat race being won by the Lieutenant, who
"beat his opponent by three feet," which seems rather unfair, as no man
ought to be allowed more than two feet to compete in a running match. In
the hurdle race the Lieutenant commenced well against the Captain, but
was unable to run him through&#8212;having unfortunately slipped in taking
the fifth hurdle. The incident is suggestive of a little parody on the
favourite military song of</p>

<h4>"March! March!"</h4>
<div class="poem1"><div class="stanza">

single inch, by this time they would have taken the Dardan-elles.</p>

<h2>THE PRINCE, THE PIGS, AND THE PARASITES.</h2>

<p>We think we have at last found a key to the flunkeyism of those
citizens
who are desirous of getting up an <span class="smcap">Albert</span>
Testimonial. The recurrence of
the Smithfield Club Cattle Show has presented the Prince Consort again
before us in the character of a prizeholder by virtue of a wonderful pen
of pigs, which proves His Royal Highness's continued devotion to porcine
development. We all know the effect of a fellow feeling, and we are
satisfied that the "greasy citizens" must entertain a natural sympathy
with those precious feats of princely care which excite so much
admiration in Baker Street. The Aldermanic mind would easily find an
excuse for gratitude, in the fact that <span class="smcap">Prince Albert</span>
 seeks to give
importance to the pig; and they would infer that he who would aggrandise
the ordinary pig would not desire to make little of the London Alderman.
For our own parts, without wishing to draw a nice distinction, we can
appreciate the views of His Royal Highness, and though he may continue
to fatten pigs for many years to come, we should not attribute to him
any desire to see the London Corporation fattening on the spoils it has
so long been allowed to appropriate.</p>

<h4>TASKING A BISHOP'S FACE.</h4>

<p>In the course of a speech delivered the other day at Southampton, the
<span class="smcap">Bishop of Oxford</span> is reported to have remarked
 that</p>

<blockquote><p>"There should be Bishops over the Clergy who would weep
when they
wept, and rejoice when they were glad."</p></blockquote>

<p>Under existing circumstances that would be a difficult arrangement.
What
with poor curates weeping on their £70 or £80 annual pittances, and rich
pluralists rejoicing at the same time in their several thousands a year,
a Bishop, in order to sympathize with both, would have to weep with one
side of his face and smile with the other.</p>

<h2>THE TROUSER MIND.</h2>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/230.png" alt="T" class="cap" width="30%" />

<p class="cap_3">THIS kind of mind struts about in fanciful costumes. It
 flaunts in
vagaries, and is always masquerading its betters. It is a mind of
colours, but colours without any union, or harmonious
combination&#8212;giving one the notion of an Irish rainbow, in which all the
hues had quarrelled, and resolved to live apart. Nothing is too broad
for it, like a Palais Royal farce. Its legs are scored like a leg of
pork&#8212;only the scoring is fearful in length, so that nothing can wipe it
out, like the debts a young man runs up at college. It is lined all over
like a zebra, and as the zebra is the animal that is next to the donkey,
the description may be said to fit it like a second skin. There is about
such a mind the emptiness of vanity coupled with all its noise&#8212;not
unlike the noise which coppers make when they jingle in an empty pocket.
Everything about it is brassy and loud&#8212;in fact it is a perfect
ophieleide of loudness that is always in full blow. It gives you the
headache to look at the owner of such a mind. Better to be right in the
middle of the orchestra than sit next to such a mind at the theatre: the
one is the soft murmur of Midsummer silence compared to the Cochin-China
cock-crowing of the other. It never whispers, but bawls, like the waiter
at a cook-shop. The mind bellows, like the poor fellows outside
<span class="smcap">Richardson's</span> show&#8212;and the greater the
bellowing the poorer the
entertainment, generally, within. Its presence is a continual jar&#8212;a jar
of sour and offensive things, like one of <span class="smcap">Goldner's</span>
 preserves. How it
swaggers! One would imagine the whole street belonged to it. It cannot
sneeze like other people, but makes ten times more noise than any sneeze
demands. It coughs to give notice of its arrival at any place&#8212;it bangs
the door to give notice of its departure. Its insolence insists upon the
best of everything&#8212;the seat nearest the fire, the best bedroom, the
best cuts at dinner, and the best attention from everybody. It always
takes the wall&#8212;it never gives way to anybody, not even to a lady. If
she wants more room, let her go into the mud! It keeps its hat on in the
presence of its superiors; but this is done more from ignorance than
bravado, for it never suspects for a moment that it has any superiors.
It stops contentedly in the middle of the room, arranges its two locks
of japanned hair, that descend like two pitcher-handles on each side of
its stony face; opens its legs, and admires its trousers with an air of
the most supreme satisfaction. The Trouser Mind rarely looks upward. The
head is to it a matter of very secondary importance, excepting as being
a block that carries so much hair. Its thoughts are all downward; and if
a person is introduced to it, the first survey is always to his boots
and trousers. It measures mankind by its nether garments. The other half
of the body is quite superfluous. In fact, the human body would, in the
opinion of the Trouser Mind, be greatly improved, if it could be so
contrived as to wear two pairs of trousers&#8212;one above and one below&#8212;and
each pair to be totally different. In the upper regions, a thunderstorm
of a pattern&#8212;in the lower, an earthquake.</p>

<h2>PROPOSALS FOR A NEW ART OF PUFFING.</h2>

<p>It has long been felt that all the old arts of puffing have been
exhausted, and the consequence is that some of the most renowned masters
of the arts formerly in vogue have retired from a field in which nothing
more can be gathered. The poet has departed from the Mart of <span
class="smcap">Moses</span>, and
the Muses that once hung round the brilliant jet of <span class="smcap">Warren</span>
 have deserted
those extensive premises in the Strand where every blacking-bottle used
to be, as it were, a jet of the Fount of Castaly.</p>

<div class="poem1"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">The harp that once in <span class="smcap">Warren's</span>
Mart</p>
<p class="i2">The soul of Music shed,</p>
<p class="i0">Now mutely lies in <span class="smcap">Warren's</span>
cart,</p>
<p class="i2">Or under <span class="smcap">Warren's</span> bed.</p>
<p class="i0">So sleeps the source of <span class="smcap">Moses'</span>
lays,</p>
<p class="i2">So <span class="smcap">Rowlands</span>' puffs are o'er;</p>
<p class="i0">And heads once wreathed in poets' bays</p>
<p class="i2">Are thumped for rhymes no more.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">No more by stanzas, songs, and odes,</p>
<p class="i2"><span class="smcap">Warren</span> his blacking sells;</p>
<p class="i0">The van alone the carman loads,</p>
<p class="i2">The name of <span class="smcap">Warren</span> tells.</p>
<p class="i0">Thus <span class="smcap">Moses</span>' muse so seldom
wakes;</p>
<p class="i2">The only sign she gives</p>
<p class="i0">Is when some silly rhymes she makes,</p>
<p class="i2">To show that still she lives.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Poetic puffing having been blown to its utmost extent until the
over-inflated windbag has burst and collapsed, the oratorical style of
puffing having departed with the late lamented <span class="smcap">George
 Robins</span>, and the
narrative or anecdotal order of puffing having been abandoned by <span
class="smcap">Rowland
and Son</span>, of scented memory, nothing remains but to invent a
novelty.
Acknowledging, as we do, that "there is nothing new under the sun," we
sit down on a day when there is no sun to be seen, and on a misty
morning in December we ask ourselves whether something new under a fog
may not be perceptible. From the huge cauldron of pea-soup, which is
emblemed in the London atmosphere, we fancy we discern something, and a
new art of puffing is revealed to us in the shape of a Proposal to
combine the Commercial with the Comic, and to establish on the ruins of
<span class="smcap">Warren's</span> fitful lyre and <span class="smcap">Moses</span>'
 muse's measures a system of comic
puffing, containing a joke in every announcement. In order to show how
the thing may be done, we give&#8212;gratis&#8212;a few specimens. We will begin
with a few jokes for Royal Tradesmen.</p>

<p>1st. The <span class="smcap">Queen's</span> shoemaker may advertise
himself as "purveyor of shoes
to the whole of <span class="smcap">Her Majesty's</span> foot," and he
may also add that "the good
footing on which Royalty stands with the people in this country is
entirely due to &amp;c. &amp;c., who makes the <span class="smcap">Queen's</span>
 shoes, and who sells
highlows, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c."</p>

<p>2nd. The <span class="smcap">Queen's</span> glover may announce that
"the affection entertained by
the whole nation for the Royal Kids is entirely due to the fact that <span
 class="smcap">Her
Majesty</span> buys all her gloves of &amp;c. &amp;c."</p>

<p>3rd. The <span class="smcap">Queen's</span> perfumer may ask
conundrumically: "Why is Royalty in
such excellent odour in England? Because all the scents used in the
palace are purchased at &amp;c. &amp;c."</p>

<p>4th. The <span class="smcap">Queen's</span> hairdresser may&#8212;with a
disregard to orthography which
is allowable in a perruquier and a punster&#8212;hazard the remark "that the
true secret of the grace and beauty which adorn the hair to the throne
is to be found in the fact that <span class="smcap">Her Majesty's</span>
 hair owes its
attractiveness to the hand of Nature and the pomade sold only by &amp;c.
 &amp;c.
&amp;c."</p>

<p>We could multiply instances over and over again. But as our object is
 to
suggest a new mine of wealth to those literary men of our day who look
to the art of puffing as a mode of obtaining an occasional blow out, we
shall not proceed to forestall them in their labours, and take out of
their mouths one morsel of that bread which, to the utter consternation
of the poet, is now selling at elevenpence the quartern.</p>

<h4>An Old Lamp and a New One.</h4>

<p>The scheme of the <span class="smcap">Archbishop of Paris</span> for
instituting a <i>fête</i> under the
name of <i>Fête des Ecoles</i>, to promote learning in connexion with
faith,
is a happy one. Everybody will agree in the sentiment expressed in his
pastoral, that "Religion and Science are the two lamps which enlighten
the world." And if by religion he means Popery, it may be permitted to
congratulate him that, happily for the human race, one of the lights
which he alludes to has put out the other's burning.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="smcap">An Improvement.</span>&#8212;The Russian army boasts of
 a <span class="smcap">Prince Stirbey</span>. We think
it would be an improvement, and only a just compliment to the aggressive
spirit of the Russians, to call him <span class="smcap">Prince Disturbey</span>.

<h2>PROPHETS IN THE PARLOUR&#8212;GYPSIES IN THE KITCHEN.</h2>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/231.png" alt="W" class="cap" width="30%" />

<p class="cap_3">When <span class="smcap">Susan</span>, maid-of-all-work
 in the regular and respectable family of
<span class="smcap">Mr. Potts</span>&#8212;small Cityman, with ambition under
his waistcoat to be some
day considerably bigger&#8212;when the aforesaid illiterate and superstitious
<span class="smcap">Susan</span>, wishing to better herself&#8212;(a vanity
that is unconsciously shared
with her even by <span class="smcap">Mr.</span> and <span class="smcap">Mrs.
 Potts</span> themselves)&#8212;gives ready ear to
<span class="smcap">Eglantine Prigduck</span>, gypsey from Barnes or
Norwood&#8212;<span class="smcap">Eglantine</span> dealing in
husbands of every variety and at the shortest notice&#8212;and, giving ear to
the prophetic gypsey, gives her at the same time an opportunity to draw
into her Maelstrom pocket or wallet certain silver spoons, afterwards
identified by <span class="smcap">Mr. Potts</span>&#8212;his own initials
lovingly intertwining with the
initials of <span class="smcap">Mrs. Potts</span>, with the family crest
 of a rampant lion licking
his tongue at posterity indubitably marking them as his property&#8212;</p>
</div>

<p>When, we say, <span class="smcap">Susan</span> weeps and knocks her
knees together, in a paroxysm
of terror before the worthy and respected <span class="smcap">Mr.
Sixmunce</span>&#8212;and the
indomitable <span class="smcap">Eglantine</span> looks callously
innocent, calling all the stars to
witness that "the gal giv her the spoons as her own goods and nobody's
else's&#8212;"</p>

<p>When <span class="smcap">Susan</span> is confronted with this alleged
 fact&#8212;the respectable part of
society of which <span class="smcap">Mr.</span> and <span class="smcap">Mrs.
 Potts</span> are such very distinguished members,
shakes its head, and wonders how ignorance at eight pounds a year, tea
and sugar included, can be such a fool as to believe in a gypsey!
However, the benevolent <span class="smcap">Mr. Sixmunce</span> commits <span
 class="smcap">Eglantine</span> to
Tothill-Fields, and&#8212;with one of those paternal remonstrances that have
won for him the proud designation of the Father of the Bench&#8212;dismisses
the grateful <span class="smcap">Susan</span> to her kitchen, <span
class="smcap">Mr.</span> and <span class="smcap">Mrs. Potts</span>, with
 a sudden
benevolence, which causes them some after astonishment and
self-congratulation on their goodness, consenting to give the creature
another trial.</p>

<p>Now at the very time that <span class="smcap">Susan</span> was
opening her homely hand, that gypsey
<span class="smcap">Eglantine</span> might read in its hard page the
marriage lines of the hopeful
maiden (who is to give sixpence at most for the glad tidings; the spoons
being purely an after-thought of the gypsey's own)&#8212;at the very time
<span class="smcap">Mrs. Potts</span> in her parlour is reading <i>Raphael's
 Prophetic Messenger</i>;
for the which she&#8212;the educated, finished <span class="smcap">Mrs. Potts</span>;
 for was she not
beautifully finished at Athens House, Wandsworth?&#8212;for the which she
has, in the best faith and best current silver, disbursed
two-and-sixpence! Ignorance crieth out in the streets, and everybody
gives ear to her. Our <i>Messenger</i> has, to be sure, a more winning
introduction than even the smiles and musical cajolery of <span
class="smcap">Eglantine
Prigduck</span>. For it has a beautiful picture in which the events of
1854 are
brought out in bold red, and blue, and orange-tawney. <span
class="smcap">Louis Naploleon</span> is
engaged chatting with <span class="smcap">Britannia</span>&#8212;(who is
asking him to run across and
take a cup of tea in London, the British Lion at her side manifesting no
objection whatever)&#8212;the while a very hairy savage has a dagger upraised
at the <span class="smcap">Emperor's</span> back, and is evidently
screwing himself up to "the
sticking place." There are mourning-coaches going to "take up" at
Windsor Castle, with other graphic amenities significant of what must
happen in the year 1854. And for this the enlightened <span
class="smcap">Mrs. Potts</span> (that
gypsey is still with <span class="smcap">Susan</span> in the kitchen)
has given two-and-sixpence;
and that too with the mighty resolution of getting her good half-crown's
worth out of it. Well, <span class="smcap">Mrs. Potts</span> begins with
 January, turning very pale
as she learns this fact:&#8212;</p>

<blockquote><p>"<i>The square of</i> <span class="smcap">Venus</span> <i>and</i>
 <span class="smcap">Saturn</span> <i>denotes severe affliction to a
lady of the highest rank</i>. The tranquillity of France is disturbed;
much excitement reigns in Paris, Lyons, Toulouse, and Rome. Turkey
and the regions of the Tigris and Euphrates are sorely afflicted."</p></blockquote>

<p>This lady&#8212;whoever she may be&#8212;has very sore afflictions throughout
twelvemonth; but then <span class="smcap">Raphael</span> must earn his
half-crown's worth.</p>

<p>In February, <span class="smcap">Mrs. Potts</span> is informed&#8212;(and
thinks with a shiver of little
<span class="smcap">Wilhelmina</span> who has not yet had the scarlet
fever)&#8212;in February:</p>

<blockquote><p>"<span class="smcap">Mars</span> retrogrades to the
opposition of the Moon in the radix of the
<span class="smcap">Princess Alice</span>, and indicates a liability to
feverish complaint or
accident."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Potts</span> has conjugal fears for the
health of <span class="smcap">Potts</span>, and resolves to
insist upon gutta percha soles. In March&#8212;</p>

<blockquote><p>"The retrogradation of <span class="smcap">Mars</span> in
 <span class="smcap">Virgo</span> in opposition to <span class="smcap">Venus</span>,
 also
<i>retrogade in</i> <span class="smcap">Pisces</span>, <i>will stir up
civil broils in Portugal;
treachery and conspiracies amongst the priesthood are directed
against the</i> <span class="smcap">Queen</span> <i>and Government of
that country</i>."</p></blockquote>

<p>Already, the poor <span class="smcap">Queen of Portugal</span> sleeps
 in the tomb of the <span class="smcap">Braganzas</span>;
but even <span class="smcap">Raphael</span> cannot be always infallible;
 not even for half-a-crown!</p>

<p>April is big with events; or rather with one event that must swallow
up
every other. <span class="smcap">Mrs. Potts</span> is a playgoer, and
with the sensibility of her
sex, would "ten to one rather see the <i>Corsican Brothers</i> than
<i>Hamlet</i>." Therefore she reads the subjoined with corresponding
perturbation.</p>

<blockquote><p>"Scandal or death awaits one renowned in the theatrical
world."</p></blockquote>

<p>This is in April! Perhaps on the first of April? It cannot be <span
class="smcap">Barry</span>, the
deathless Clown, who shall be snatched from us? If, then, it should be
the&#8212;the&#8212;the "renowned"&#8212;but no! we will not, we <i>cannot</i> think of
it!
Ha! ha! ha! <i>Sardanapalus</i> is himself again!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">May</span> is full of danger as of hawthorn. What
 <i>can</i> the loyal <span class="smcap">Mrs. Potts</span>
think of this?</p>

<blockquote><p>"<span class="smcap">Mars</span> hastens, <i>as it were</i>,
 to apply the torch to the train of evil
he has previously laid. <i>The highest power in the land is grievously
afflicted.</i> It is the earnest prayer of <span class="smcap">Raphael</span>,
 that the direful
influence of <span class="smcap">Saturn</span> on the ascending degree
and radical place of the
luminaries in our beloved Sovereign's horoscope may be averted."</p></blockquote>

<p>But this is nothing. "The highest power" is continually threatened; a
prediction that, in the days of <span class="smcap">Queen Bess</span>,
would&#8212;we doubt not&#8212;have
helped <span class="smcap">Raphael</span> to the highest gibbet. Again <span
 class="smcap">Raphael</span> turns the penny upon
"our beloved Sovereign." In June, he says&#8212;</p>

<blockquote><p>"<span class="smcap">I dare not</span> fully enter into <span
 class="smcap">ALL</span> the important significations of
these positions and configurations. <i>I sincerely pray that the
health of our beloved Sovereign</i> may be preserved, in which I am
assured her subjects will universally join."</p></blockquote>

<p>(Do we not behold <span class="smcap">Raphael</span> on his bended
knees, "sincerely praying," with
the half-crown in his mouth?) In July, however, our prophet makes
merchandize of the <span class="smcap">Queen's</span> children.</p>

<blockquote><p>"Saturn transits the place of the Sun in the nativity of
the
<span class="smcap">Princess Helena</span>, producing a tendency <i>to
disease in the chest</i>,
&amp;c., at the end of June and beginning of July. The 7th and 8th <i>are
evil
 days</i> for the <span class="smcap">Prince of Wales</span>, and the
19th for the <span class="smcap">Prince
Arthur</span>. <i>Their attendants should carefully avoid accident.</i>"</p></blockquote>

<p>These would have made very "evil days" for our prophet; evil as
pillory
and cart-whip could have shaped them. But we live in liberal times, and
the Astrologer may turn his half-crown upon the probable diseased chest
of the little <span class="smcap">Princess Helena</span>, and the
threatened dangers of <span class="smcap">Princes
Albert</span> and <span class="smcap">Arthur</span>!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Potts</span> reads in August that "the <span
 class="smcap">King of Naples</span> should beware of
female intrigue, poison, or the assassin;" and&#8212;controlling her
emotion&#8212;turns over to September, where she learns among other not
impossible events that "great cruelty is displayed towards <i>some
female</i>
about the 27th." <span class="smcap">Mrs. Potts</span> thinks October a
little slow. "Public
writers and scientific men are unsuccessful:" and what of that? "The
fine arts prosper!" Bother the fine arts: and straightway <span
class="smcap">Mrs. Potts</span>
passes to November, <i>when</i></p>

<blockquote><p>"Much excitement reigns throughout the land; the long
talked of
invading army may, under these influences, make its appearance, and
ere many months '<i>the wolf will come</i>.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>With the intuitive calculation of woman, <span class="smcap">Mrs.
Potts</span> wonders where on
earth she and <span class="smcap">Potts</span> are to sleep, if the
Russians&#8212;which, of course, is
meant by the wolf&#8212;is quartered upon 'em?</p>

<p>But this is nothing to what is threatened in December. <span
class="smcap">Mrs. Potts</span>
continues to read with&#8212;very naturally&#8212;increasing fear and amazement.
Fear for <span class="smcap">Her Majesty</span> the <span class="smcap">Queen</span>,
 and amazement at things in general!
"Heaven preserve!"&#8212;cries the prophet in ominous tones&#8212;"Heaven preserve
the health of our Sovereign, and also of her people!"&#8212;ending with the
new version of a Dead March, set after this fashion:&#8212;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Dark and gloomy clouds hover over us; and I regret to
add that
during the year 1855 the significations are still fearfully evil. I
cannot at present discover one ray of hope."</p></blockquote>

<p>What? Not for half-a-crown? Suppose, then, we make it
three-and-sixpence!</p>

<p>Now, whilst the <span class="smcap">Pottses</span> continue to read
the <i>Prophetic Raphael</i>&#8212;(it is
the vagabond's "thirty-fourth year")&#8212;in<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span> the parlour&#8212;should
they
wonder at, should they punish poor <span class="smcap">Susan</span> with
 the gypsey in the kitchen?</p>

<p>Take care&#8212;oh, ye masters and mistresses!&#8212;of the half-crowns, and in
good time the spoons will take care of themselves.</p>

<h2>A GOOD HATER OF BLUE-STOCKINGS.</h2>

<p>"If anything could increase my extreme horror of Blue-Stockings, it
would be the terrible suspicion I cannot divest myself of that every
Blue-Stocking drinks. I fancy that the only person she pays her devoirs
to&#8212;and those only in secret&#8212;is <span class="smcap">Old Tom</span>; and that it is as
much as she can do to keep her lips away from him. The suspicion is a
very ungallant one, but I cannot help imagining that when two
Blue-Stockings get together, they do love a good soaking. In fact, who
was the goddess who first gave her countenance to Gin? <span class="smcap">Pallas</span>, to be
sure; and her very origin was the result of a drunken frolic, for are we

<h2>PHRENOLOGICAL ORGAN MUSIC.</h2>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/232b.png" alt="T" class="cap" width="30%" />

<p class="cap_3">THE Philharmonic Concerts are tolerably good; those of
the Sacred
Harmonic Society are pretty fair, but there is a musical entertainment
now going on which, if it realises the object it aims at, must beat
every other quite out of the field. A lady, <span class="smcap">Mrs.
Hamilton</span>, under the
title of "Practical Phrenologist," professes, by advertisement, to give
public performances, described by her as "Phrenology illustrated by
Music." The shallow punster will of course remark that he imagined that
the only organs susceptible of musical expression were those of the sort
invented by <span class="smcap">St. Cecilia</span>, and not such as were
 discovered by <span class="smcap">Gall</span> and
<span class="smcap">Spurzheim</span>; except that the phrenological
organ of tune might, perhaps,
sing for itself. However, <span class="smcap">Handel</span> may be
considered to have illustrated
the organ of Veneration in his Oratorios; <span class="smcap">Weber</span>
 that of Marvellousness
in his <i>Der Freischütz</i> and <i>Oberon</i>; <span class="smcap">Beethoven</span>
 that of Ideality and the
organs of the other sentiments proper to man, in combination with those
of the reflective faculties, in his symphonies and sonatas; <span
class="smcap">Bellini</span> and
<span class="smcap">Donizetti</span> the organs of Adhesiveness and
Amativeness. <span class="smcap">Rossini</span> might also
be adduced as an illustrator of Gaiety or Mirthfulness, and Imitation,
or the dramatic organ. But <span class="smcap">Mrs. Hamilton's</span>
music, which is to illustrate
Phrenology at large, and consequently all the organs, must, if it
accomplishes as much as it attempts, be equal to <span class="smcap">Handel's</span>,
 <span class="smcap">Beethoven's</span>,
<span class="smcap">Weber's</span>, <span class="smcap">Rossini's</span>,
 <span class="smcap">Bellini's</span>, <span class="smcap">Donizetti's</span>;
 indeed to the music of all
the great composers put together. She must be a sort of musical
<span class="smcap">Shakspere</span>&#8212;than whom nobody else ever
succeeded in giving illustrations
of Phrenology, or the philosophy of human nature, at large.</p>
</div>

<p>To illustrate the whole of Phrenology by Music in one evening must be
impossible. The shortest way to do it would be by means of a symphony,
consisting of no less than thirty-five movements, if we are to consider
the "Love of Life" and "Alimentiveness" as established organs. The
latter of these might he elucidated, musically, by the introduction of
"<i>The Roast Beef of Old England</i>;" for the former, just now, the
best
notion would, perhaps, be the Russian National Anthem turned into a
fugue, to signify <span class="smcap">Prince Gortschakoff's</span>
troops saving themselves as fast
as possible from <span class="smcap">Omar Pacha</span>. But a series of
performances would be
required by the extensive nature of the subject; for any one organ,
taken in all its combinations, might be played upon for a whole evening.
Some of the organs are susceptible enough of musical treatment:
"Philoprogenitiveness," or the instinct of paternal and maternal
affection, but more especially of the latter, has its melody in the
music of nature, as heard in the nursery, or issuing therefrom, mellowed
by distance&#8212;the mellower from that cause the better. The effect in
question <span class="smcap">Mrs. Hamilton</span> (who appears to be a
Scottish lady) might produce
by the judicious employment&#8212;it would have to be judicious&#8212;of the
bagpipes. "Acquisitiveness" rejoices in the jingling of money, which
might be expressed by means of the triangles, introducing the
appropriated air of "<i>Still so gently o'er me stealing</i>."
"Self-esteem"
would blow its own trumpet, of course; the want of it being expressed by
transition to a minor key. "Destructiveness" could be disposed of by a
crash. "Combativeness" might come out in the drums and fifes. "Firmness"
might persist in a violoncello accompaniment. "Cautiousness," slow and
sure, would speak in a gentle <i>adagio</i>. A lively <i>allegretto</i>
would
represent "Wit." The music of Masonry would supply some hints for
"Constructiveness." There are organs, however, which may rather puzzle a
composer. No harmonious measures that one can well imagine would give
any idea of "Form" or "Size," and "Locality" would seem to be quite out
of the musical way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hamilton</span> informs the public, that she
 will lecture on living heads
from the audience, assisted by the celebrated <span class="smcap">Mrs.
Carter</span>, "the <span class="smcap">Jenny
Lind</span> of Scotland." Hence, it seems that the music will be, partly
 at
least, vocal. It may be surmised that <span class="smcap">Mrs.
Hamilton's</span> lecture consists
principally of recitative, which would be more suitable than an <i>aria</i>,
a <i>bravura</i>, a <i>canzonet</i>, or a part in a duet, to the
statement of
anatomical and physiological facts. <span class="smcap">Mrs. Carter</span>,
 we are told, will sing
Scotch, English, and Irish songs. There is an Irish song called
"<i>Donnybrook Fair</i>," which alludes strongly to the shillelagh, and
may
therefore be conceived to be very pertinent to bumps. England,
doubtless, has ballads adapted to various organs besides the grinding;
and in addition to "<i>John Andersen my Jo</i>," and many other songs of
 the
affective faculties, there is a particular Scotch song that might be
very useful to a lecturer on Phrenology. <span class="smcap">Mrs.
Hamilton</span>, in lecturing on
living heads, may be obliged to describe the upper story of some
gentleman as being similar in its build to that of the late <span
class="smcap">Mr. Rush</span>.
Any unpleasant feeling, or objection on his part to such a statement,
might be quelled by <span class="smcap">Mrs. Carter</span> immediately
striking up, "<i>A man's a man
for a' that</i>."</p>

<p>Whether Phrenology is made any clearer or not by <span class="smcap">Mrs.
 Hamilton's</span> musical
illustrations of it, we dare say that those illustrations are anyhow
very well worth hearing.</p>

<h4>Fine Feeders.</h4>

<p>It appears that the Sheriffs of London are fined from £500 to £600,
in
the guise of a subscription to the <span class="smcap">Lord Mayor's</span>
 Dinner. Now this is a
tolerable fork-out, for any one who can stand it, even if destined to
the promotion of a high object, but considering what kind of purpose it
is actually squandered on, we must call it a knife-and-fork-out that is
quite intolerable.</p>

check was presented to him by the Turks.</p>

<h2>NEGLECTED SCOTLAND.</h2>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 40%;">
<a href="images/234a.png">
<img src="images/234a.png" alt="A fox chasing hounds" width="100%" /></a>
</div>

<p>A sensible Scotchman writing from Haddington to the <i>Times</i>,
says that
"the real grievances of Scotland are not her insulted Lions, nor her
deserted Holyrood," but lie in "her ill-paved, worse-lighted and
undrained market-towns, and in the incurable apathy of the inhabitants
to sanitary reform."</p>

<p>This gentleman says that, on Tuesday last, at a meeting of the
inhabitants of Haddington, it was proposed to adopt the drainage clauses
of the New Police Act. After an earnest and solemn appeal from their
parish minister imploring them "to unite with heart and hand in bringing
the influences of pure air and water to bear on the wretched homes of
their poorer brethren," followed by an awful warning from a medical
officer of the town, "the householders (many of them wealthy men)"
rejected, by a majority of ten to one, a bill for their assessment, in
order to have their streets and houses cleansed, at the rate of 10<i>d.</i>
in the pound.</p>

<p>A week previously, the <span class="smcap">Scotchman</span> states,
the Haddingtonians had devoted
a day to fasting and humiliation in the hope that the pestilence might
be averted from them.</p>

<p>Fasting involves self-denial. The Haddington fasters cannot deny
themselves to the amount of 10<i>d.</i> in the pound. They cannot fling
that
tenpence into the gutter, to sweep it, although the gutter is poisoning
their poor neighbours, and may poison themselves too.</p>

<p>Christians are supposed to wash their faces when they fast. Whether
the
Haddington housekeepers accompany their fasting with any ablution may be
doubted, since they refuse to pay 10<i>d.</i> in the pound for washing
their
town. By preference, for cheapness sake, they would rather perhaps fast
in sackcloth and ashes; but as all sackcloth is now used up in sacks,
whilst ashes are carted away for manure, their fasting possibly consists
in wearing their usual clothes, and sitting still in their usual filth,
and doing nothing. Whether they abstain from anything else&#8212;from haggis
or sheep's head, or collops, or whiskey-toddy&#8212;in addition to abstinence
from wholesome exertion&#8212;we do not know.</p>

<p>As to the Scotch Lion playing second fiddle in the Royal Arms, he may
bless the sometime <span class="smcap">Duke of Argyle</span> and his
stars, and be contented to
have any place there to fiddle in at all. By all heraldic right he ought
to be ousted altogether, and his place should be occupied by the more
appropriate emblem of a Pig; a whining, grunting, odoriferous Hog
Rampant, sprawling in the filth of towns.</p>

<hr />

<h2>GARE LA GAROTTE.</h2>

<p>Our friend and contemporary the <i>Sunday Times</i> (whose zeal for
the
spread of Democracy, for the non-suppression of Betting Houses, and for
the purification of the Turf and the Church, we gladly recognise), in
commenting upon an excellent article in which the daily <i>Times</i>
dissuades the charitable from encouraging street mendicancy, has the
following startling remarks:&#8212;</p>

<blockquote><p>"While on this part of the subject, we would suggest the
impolicy of
withholding from the metropolitan mendicants, whether impostors or
not, the scanty means of support.... We would counsel the old ladies
and gentlemen <i>not to hold their hands</i>, lest the sturdy vagabond,
who now contents himself with extracting pence from their humanity
by whining, <i>should take to strangling them in the dark streets</i>,
as
some members of the fraternity have lately done in Manchester."</p></blockquote>

<p>Really, <i>Mr. Punch</i>, who believes that in his time he has done
no bad
service to the cause of real Democracy (by which he means a system for
the benefit of the many and not of the few), begs to say that these
utterances by the "Champion of Democracy," are more worthy of one of the
ruined clients of the <i>Sunday Times</i>, the Betting House Keepers
(who may
now be properly termed vagabonds), than of a respectable journalist with
his faculties in order. Threatening decent people with strangulation
because they decline to assist imposture, is rather a strong argument.
Luckily, there be things called Policemen.</p>

<hr />

<h2><i>PUNCH</i> AND HIS PIPPINS.</h2>

<p>The "immediate apple of our eye" is an American apple, which we
happen
to have in our eye at the present moment. It is not an apple of discord,
but an apple which comes home to our very heart's core with its
assurances of friendship. A Correspondent, who signs himself "<span
class="smcap">The
American Enthusiast</span>," has allowed his enthusiasm to take the very
sensible turn of a present of apples to <i>Punch</i>, who, while
receiving
it, proceeds to cut it up; and, like some critics, shows his taste by
making mince-meat of it. We have perused the whole of the apples with
great satisfaction, and though we might find a spot here and there, the
blemish is only on the surface; for when we descend a little lower than
skin deep, we find the apple quite worthy of the appellation of the
American Prince of Pippins, which we hereby confer on it.</p>

<h4>Interest for Prince Albert's Statue.</h4>

<p>Give <span class="smcap">Prince Albert</span> a Statue?&#8212;Yes,
certainly, at the proper time; may it
not arrive for a thousand years! But when it does arrive, up with the
Statue; a Statue which shall have been merited by a highly useful life,
whereof the promotion of the cosmopolitan fair in Hyde Park will have
been one only among the remarkable acts. In the mean time, that the
memorial may be worthy of the hero, put the money already subscribed
towards it out to increase and accumulate; by which means, in addition
to the interest which our descendants will take in the work, we shall
also transmit to them compound interest that will help to pay for it.</p>

<h4>"TUNBRIDGE WELLS. PETTY SESSION,</h4>

<h5>Nov. 12.</h5>

<center>"<i>Before</i> <span class="smcap">J. Deane, Esq.</span></center>

<blockquote><p>"<span class="smcap">Hawking Without A License.</span>&#8212;<span
 class="smcap">Michael Derley</span> was brought up in
custody, charged with selling mats without a license. The accused
did not deny the charge, but contended that he had a right to do so,
as he manufactured the articles himself. He had done the same thing
in hundreds of towns, and had never before been interrupted; <i>he had
his mother and brother to support, both of whom were deaf and dumb</i>.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Mr. Deane</span> inquired if the prisoner had
been cautioned, and on
receiving a reply in the affirmative (from <span class="smcap">P. C.
Morgan</span>) intimated
that he could not allow the statement of the prisoner to influence
his decision. The tradesmen of the town, as well as persons taking
out licenses for hawking, must be protected, and he (the prisoner)
must pay a <i>fine of</i> £10, <i>or go to prison for seven days</i>.</p>

<p>"The prisoner requested <span class="smcap">Mr. Deane</span> to
inform him under what Act he
was committed.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Mr. Deane</span> declined to give the
information.</p>

<p>"The Clerk to the prisoner&#8212;You can find that out when you get to
gaol."</p></blockquote>

<p>Is there any mistake here? Was it for stealing mats that the prisoner
was committed instead of being sent to gaol for selling them? If not,
does there exist a law so atrocious as to warrant his committal?&#8212;if
there is no such law, breathes there such a magistrate as <span
class="smcap">Mr. Deane</span>? And
does Mr. Deane continue to hold a place on the Bench?</p>

<p>The poor man appears to have had a judge, as well as a mother and a
brother, afflicted with deafness, if not dumb. <span class="smcap">Mr.
Deane</span> was deaf to his
appeal for mercy, and dumb when challenged to justify his punishment. We
cannot say, we hope that <span class="smcap">Derley</span> obtained the
information which he was so
kindly informed that he might seek for in gaol. If no Act existed to
warrant his incarceration, he would have a legal remedy for what
morally, at any rate, was a false imprisonment.</p>

<h2>DEBATE ON THE HUDSON QUESTION.</h2>

<center>(<i>By slight Anticipation.</i>)</center>
<hr class="short" />
<center>IMPERIAL PARLIAMENT&#8212;Monday, 13th February, 1854.<br /><br />

<p>Their Lordships met at 5, but rose immediately, in order to afford
various Peers an opportunity of hearing what was going on elsewhere.</p>

<center>HOUSE OF COMMONS.</center>

<p>Petitions having been presented, notices of motion given, and
questions
disposed of.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Roebuck</span> rose to bring on the motion
which he had placed on the book.
He said he should be very short (<i>A laugh</i>). He could not express
his
loathing and contempt for the vulgar and brutal ribaldry which could
find matter for a grin in a man's appearance. He should be temperate, as
all the world knew he always was (<i>Hear, hear</i>), and should merely
read
to the House an extract from a document to which the Hon. Member for
Sunderland had sworn, and which that Hon. Member had placed on record in
a Court of Justice, in which <span class="smcap">Mr. Hudson</span>&#8212;(<i>Order</i>)
 What was the use of
the servile pedantry that adhered to rotten forms? (<i>Order</i>.) Well,
 in
which the honourable&#8212;very honourable&#8212;right honourable&#8212;would that
do?&#8212;Member swore that he had expended certain moneys, or used other
means, in bribing and corrupting members of the legislature to favour
railway schemes in which he was interested. Conceiving that a legislator
who could bring such a charge against his fellows was utterly unfit to
sit among them, he should&#8212;without the least personal feeling&#8212;move that
<span class="smcap">Mr. George Hudson</span> be expelled the House of
Commons (<i>Hear, hear</i>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Henry Drummond</span> seconded the motion,
but only for the purpose of
saying that he perfectly believed every word to which <span
class="smcap">Mr. Hudson</span> had
sworn (<i>Hear, hear</i>). He had last session given Lords and Commons,
aye,
and Ministers and Knights of the Garter too, his opinion of the extent
to which corruption was carried in these days, and he reiterated his
assertions. Still, though offences were to come, woe to them by whom
they came, and therefore he should support <span class="smcap">Mr.
Roebuck</span>.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Speaker</span> having put the motion,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord John Russell</span>, as leader of that
House, said that he should make
very few remarks on a very painful subject. He had carefully looked into
Magna Charta, and also into the Bill of Rights, and was inclined to
believe that neither made any provision for the case of a railway
director who should endeavour to promote steam-traffic by unlawful
means. So far they were in the dark. But it was desirable, nay,
necessary, to consider rather the spirit of the constitution than its
exact letter, and he thought that if the House would refer the matter to
a Select Committee, they might attain their object. The instruction to
that Committee would be to inquire, first, whether steam carriages were
known in the days of <span class="smcap">King John</span>, and if not,
whether any portion of Magna
Charta appeared to bear on the case. Next, he thought, the Committee
might inquire whether, at the Revolution, steam travelling had been
invented, and how far the Bill of Rights might have contemplated
wrongful Railway Bills. On receiving the report the House would
determine on its next step. (<i>Hear.</i>) He moved an amendment in
accordance with his suggestion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Disraeli</span> was the last person to infuse
 into a question any element
not patently consanguineous with it; but, with all deference to the
noble Lord, he must respectfully inquire whether the noble Lord's
suggestion did not tend to the implicit stultification of the House.
Why, the noble Lord asked the Committee what he had already told them
himself, and did not ask that which it was momentous to register;
namely, whether in the chancery archives a damnatory record had been
deposited. (<i>Hear, hear</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colonel Sibthorp</span> said that the noble Lord
professed a great deal of
virtue, which was all humbug. <i>Facilis descensus Averni</i>. He
believed
all Ministers to be knaves, especially when they most pretended to
decency. <i>Timeo Danaos et dona ferentes.</i> He should leave the House
(<i>laughter</i>); but before he went, he would just say that if the
noble
Lord, instead of wallowing in turtle and champagne (<i>laughter</i>),
would
introduce wise measures, he should be supported by wise men, himself
amongst the rest. <i>Judex damnatur cum nocens absolvitur.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. G. H. Moore</span> said that had <span
class="smcap">Mr. Hudson</span> been an Irish Member he would
have been expelled long ago, but such was the beastly bitterness of
England towards his, <span class="smcap">Mr. Moore's</span>, unhappy
countrymen that, as <span class="smcap">Mr. Hudson</span>
usually sat near the Irish Members, he was allowed to remain there in
the hopes that he might contaminate the high and pure morality which
they had learned from their beloved priests, and which shed a holy and
blessed light around their path, to the utter discomfiture of the
bigoted, blatant, and blasphemous Protestants.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Lucas</span> confirmed <span class="smcap">Mr.
 Moore's</span> statement as to the virtues of the
Irish, and the wickedness of the English, and made an animated attack
upon the Church of England, adding an affecting history of the
persecutions to which Catholics were exposed in Protestant countries.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Duffy</span>, <span class="smcap">Mr. Scully</span>,
 <span class="smcap">Captain Magan</span>, and other Irish Members
having
dilated upon this branch of the subject for about two hours, <span
class="smcap">Lord
Palmerston</span> suggested&#8212;he hoped that as&#8212;a&#8212;a&#8212;an Irish proprietor, he
might be permitted to offer a hint to Irish gentlemen (<i>laughter and
cheers</i>), that they were a little departing from the points which
perhaps offered themselves most prominently; at any rate&#8212;a&#8212;a&#8212;so it
seemed to him. (<i>Hear.</i>) Perhaps it might be advantageous on the
present
occasion to&#8212;a&#8212;a&#8212;sink the <span class="smcap">Pope</span>. (<i>Great
uproar on the Irish bench.</i>)
Of course he meant nothing offensive to His&#8212;a&#8212;a&#8212;Holiness.
(<i>Laughter.</i>) Honourable gentlemen had certainly travelled very
far, but
they seemed to have avoided Hudson's Bay. (<i>Shouts of laughter and
cheers.</i>) He thought, really, that as the Hon. Member for Sunderland
was
present, he might be asked whether he had anything to say for himself.
English gentlemen were not in the habit of acting harshly or
inconsiderately. (<i>Loud cheers.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">An Irish Member</span> (<i>indignantly</i>). "Are
 Irish?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Palmerston</span> (<i>laughing</i>). "<i>Qui
 capit ille facit</i>", you know."</p>

<p>There were then calls for&#8212;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Hudson</span>, who rose and said, "My
position is noways pleasant, and I
shall not intrude long upon the ouse. In the first place I never said,
exactually, that I had bribed members of the legislature, but only that
I had applied shares in a way calculated to promote the interests of a
certain company. What I've said, I've sworn to; and what I've sworn to,
I stick to, of course. I don't see anything to be ashamed of in what I
have done; but people differ on these points, and every man has a right
to his own opinion. The ouse can do as it likes. But one thing I do mean
to say, and that is, that if the ouse has a bad opinion of me, I've a
precious bad opinion of a good many people in the ouse, and out of it
too. What was I? A provincial shopkeeper, who was lucky enough to make a
deal of money. Very well. Did I court Dukes, and Markisses, and M.P.'s,
and orficers in the Guards, and dowagers, and debbytarntes, and all
that? Not I. They courted me. They came to my ouse, and ate my dinners,
and flattered my family, because I'd got a load of money, no matter how;
and because some of 'em thought they'd get a slice, the others wanted me
to put 'em up to dodges to get money for themselves. Same in this ouse.
I couldn't come in here, when I was rich, as the right hon. gentleman in
the cheer has seen and knows, but a mob of young aristocrats, aye and
old ones too, all gathered round my white waistcoat, and were all
fawning and affable, and jocose like. Now, see how they keep away; and
if I run against them, some cut me, some only nod. Is it because I'm
worse than I was? No, only because I'm worse off. My golden sunshine
brought out the vermin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257"
id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span> and now that's gone they're gone too.
You may
expel me, but you can't make me forget, when I had my big ouse which the
French have taken, how Lords, and Barnets, and Guardsmen, and the Hort
No Bless, and their females crawled and cringed and fawned to the rich
Yorkshire linendraper. And if I git right, as I don't doubt to do, I
shall have 'em round me again. Money does the trick in England, and it's
despicable cant to say it don't. I am in the ands of the ouse."</p>

<p>The Hon. Member's address caused considerable sensation, especially
among certain strangers in the privileged galleries. <span class="smcap">Mr.
 Henry Drummond</span>
was observed to rub his hands with much enjoyment. <span class="smcap">Lord
 John Russell's</span>
amendment was negatived without a division, <span class="smcap">Mr.
Roebuck's</span> motion was
then carried, and, on the motion of <span class="smcap">Mr. Wilson</span>,
 a new writ was ordered
for Sunderland, vacant by the expulsion of <span class="smcap">Mr.
George Hudson</span>.</p>

<h2>THE FASHIONABLE ZOOLOGICAL STAR.</h2>

<p>We are sorry to see that the Zoological Gardens have lately got into
the
"Star system." Not content with a good working company of bears and
monkeys, they must have particular "Stars" to bring the million in. Some
time ago it was a hippopotamus, who made all London run after him. Then
there was the baby elephant, who was a source of great interest to
mothers. After them followed a chimpanzee, and a serpent-charmer, and a
whole forest-full of humming-birds, and we cannot recollect what else.
All of them, however, were great attractions in their way; in fact, it
may be said that the animals lately have completely taken the shine out
of the actors. As the theatres have gradually become more empty, the
Zoological Gardens have perceptibly become more crowded. What actor,
recently, has had anything like the success that for a whole season ran
panting, pushing and squeezing after the Hippopotamus? It was a fight of
parasols to get near him&#8212;it was a joy greater than that of a new gown.
To have seen him! What is the reason of this strange preference? Is it
because the public prefer Nature to Art?&#8212;or is it because the actors
speak, and the animals do not?</p>

<p>However, the "Star system" is not likely to be so ruinous here as at
most places of entertainment. We need not say that the Zoological Stars
receive no salaries, beyond their board and lodging; and they are not
likely to ruin their managers with salaries like those. They are paid
regularly every day at the usual feeding hour, and we have not heard of
an instance of any animal, no matter how popular he may have been,
having struck for more beans, or refusing to make his appearance unless
he had a double allowance of paunches.</p>

<p>The latest "Star" at this establishment is the Giant Ant-Eater&#8212;that
is
to say, if you can call him a Star at all, for, with a tail like his, he
is much more like a comet. It is indeed a tail!&#8212;so long is it, that you
imagine it must have been originally published in four-and-twenty
numbers, and that they are here all bound up together. And a pretty
thick volume it makes too! <span class="smcap">Daniel O'Connell's</span>
 "tail" must have been a
wisp of straw compared to it. It hangs like a small willow tree&#8212;only
instead of being green, it is a dark badger colour, and, in texture,
resembles some of the long brushes we have seen made of Indian grass. It
is as flexible as a party-politician, for it can be turned at will to
any side. What is the use of such a tail it would be difficult to say,
though as far as that goes, you might as well ask what was the use of a
lady's bonnet, for the one is not worn more at the back than the other.
When the Ant-Eater lies down to sleep, he throws this voluminous tail,
like a Scotch plaid, round him, and we have no doubt it keeps him very
warm. So, you see, it is of some use after all; and, for what we know,
as he comes from a very warm climate, the Ant-Eater may use his tail in
the summer to fan himself with. We are told that he is met with in the
plains of the Brazils; but, from his habit of spreading his thick hedge
of a tail all over his body, we should say that he was much oftener
found in the Bush. In fact, it is a complete furs-bush&#8212;extending out
nearly to the same length as his body. He is a curious animal, take him
altogether. In shape he reminds you somewhat of a German pig, which is
not the most elegant object a person can meet with on a long day's
journey; only a German pig would be an English greyhound in symmetry by
the side of him. The Ant-Eater is as hairy as a goat, and all along the
ridge of his neck he carries a long frill of hair that stands upright,
short and thick, like a long plate-brush turned upside down. Then the
hair falls down his front legs, taking the form of a pair of black
top-boots. These front legs look at first like hoofs, for the nails, the
length of which any woman of spirit would envy, are turned underneath,
and the noise he makes in walking upon them sounds exactly as if he had
got clogs on. His snout, also, is extremely peculiar, being admirably
adapted, from its length and narrowness, for getting the marrow out of a
marrow-bone. It is longer than any cucumber reared by a penny-a-liner,
only gradually tapering towards the end, in which is enclosed the
tongue, to which it seems to act as a sort of case.</p>

<p>This case is made of bone; and, really, when the tongue issues from
it,
it looks like some very fine surgical instrument that had shot out of
its case upon a spring being touched. We hardly know what to compare the
snout to, unless it is a very long and thin strawberry pottle, that some
wicked boys have been tying over his mouth. This strawberry pottle is
his only feature, for his eyes are so small that they are rather eyelet
holes than eyes; but then, in its great bounty it more than balances,
and leaves a large surplus over, for the miserable poverty of his other
features. We know of no other animal that could be so easily led by the
nose. As for his coat, the hair on it takes various colours. You remark
a long stripe of red running by the side of a long stripe of black or
yellow. The colours, on his breast particularly, are as distinct, and
the lines as sharply marked, as the different-coloured grains you see
arranged in a seedsman's window. The poor animal looks remarkably
stupid, but happy. He wanders about his cage in a very inquiring manner,
looking for his blessed ants, whom he cannot find anywhere, and making
with his claws the noise of a French peasant walking in wooden shoes. He
leads a very fashionable life, being up generally all night, and
sleeping all day. There his accomplishments seem to begin and end; for
he does not sing, nor bray, nor bark, nor low, nor whistle, nor make any
noise whatever, except the one with his toe-nails, which must be
particularly disagreeable during the night to the poor Chimpanzee who
lives in the next cage to him. We tried very hard to dive into the
Ant-Eater's thoughts; but, with all our diving, could not bring up any
satisfactory proof whether the beast was aware of the great popularity
he had suddenly rushed into. Like <span class="smcap">Byron</span>, we
suppose he awoke one
morning, and found himself famous. Let him not be too conceited, for
"Stars" rise and fall at the Zoological just as quickly as at other
places.</p>

<h4>Shameful Deafness and Defective Hearing.</h4>

<p>The late delivery of letters, and the illegal retention of books and

remonstrances to be addressed to those officials, but without effect.
The reason probably will be found in a new proverb, which it has become
necessary to substitute for an old one. Instead of saying Deaf as the

<h2>CLERGYMEN IN THE FARCE OF "TURNING THE TABLES."</h2>

<p>Table Turning seems to be turning the heads of the parsons, and
Spirit
Rapping is likely to give a rap to certain Reverends which they will not
speedily recover from. We confess to some experience in the practise of
Spirit Rapping in connection with Tables, but the spirits employed in
rapping have always been in tumblers of one kind or another. We have
frequently suspected Satanic agency in some portions of our furniture,
particularly in a quantity of cheap stuff which we purchased at a
furniture mart, and which is scarcely worth the rap we have bestowed on
it. We are in possession of a round table which is subject to fits of
groaning and creaking, with an occasional tendency to the splitting of
its sides, as if in very mockery of merriment. We must confess that the
refractory table has been occasionally a good deal put upon.</p>

<p>The Clerical Table Turners seem to imagine that the Satanic agency is
confined to a particular kind of furniture, but our own opinion is, that
we are just as likely to find the "old gentleman" in the chair as in any
other portion of our moveables. We do not see why the presence of the
evil one should be confined to the work of the cabinet-maker or the
carpenter, and indeed there are several articles of hardware which
appear to be liable to visitations from invisible beings. Our own stock
of crockery is undoubtedly exposed to such contingencies, for we now and
then find an amount of breakage which, if our servants are to be
believed, has not been done by any earthly agency.</p>

<h2>SURE SYMPTOMS OF CHRISTMAS.</h2>

<center>(<i>By a Surly Old Bachelor.</i>)</center>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/239.png" alt="P" class="cap" width="20%" />

<p class="cap_3">PUNCH,&#8212;I know Christmas is coming from certain
well-known symptoms that
never fail to present themselves at this time of the year:&#8212;</p>
</div>

<p>Because my landlady is so extremely civil to me, and brings me my
shaving-water the moment I ring for it.</p>

<p>Because I have not had to complain for two weeks about my boots, and
the
coal-scuttle is generally pretty full of coals.</p>

<p>Because the breakfast is laid before I am up, and when I ask for
toast
with my tea in the evening, the kitchen fire has not once been out.</p>

<p>Because the impudent news-boy has been much earlier with the
newspaper
than usual.</p>

<p>Because, wherever I have called, I haven't had cold meat for dinner
for
ever so long&#8212;for two weeks at least.</p>

<p>Because I cannot get my bills in from my tradesmen&#8212;they smile, and
scrape their feet in their vile sawdust, and murmur something about "any
time will do, Sir," and present me with French plum and bonbon-boxes,
and fancy I have nothing better to do than to lay in a plantation of
Christmas trees.</p>

<p>Because the crossing-sweeper takes his hat off to me every time I
pass.</p>

<p>Because the Beadle has been wonderfully profuse with his cocked hat,
and
the pew-opener, within the last fortnight, has nearly curtseyed me to
death.</p>

<p>Because, wherever I have called, I have found all the servants
smiling
most unnaturally, and bringing me things I didn't want.</p>

<p>Because my little nephews have been so very affectionate to me
lately.</p>

<p>Because my little nieces have run up to me, and kissed me in a way
that
was more flattering than agreeable, and I have had my great coat and hat
and umbrella and goloshes pulled off me before I have had time to
inquire whether my brother (he is only a clerk) was at home.</p>

<p>Because I have been bothered out of my life with so many inquiries
about
that "distressing cough" of mine, and have been recommended so many
wonderful remedies that were sure to cure it,&#8212;which remedies, if I had
only taken one half of them, I shouldn't be alive at the present moment.</p>

<p>Because the Waits wake me up at night, paying me the discordant
compliment of playing opposite my window longer than anybody else's.</p>

<p>And because&#8212;but I think I have said enough of these symptoms, which
luckily "come but once a year." After all, I don't know&#8212;perhaps they
are not so disagreeable, for the attentions one receives at this period
are as flattering to one's vanity as they are conducive to one's
comfort. The worst is, one knows they all spring out of a Christmas
Box&#8212;and these boxes, as I have learnt to my cost, are not to be had so
cheaply as bandboxes. The enjoyment would be all the more enjoyable, if
one hadn't to pay so dearly for it. During the Christmas month, my
outgoings invariably exceed my incomings;&#8212;otherwise, I like it well
enough, and shouldn't mind if the whole year were composed of nothing
but Christmas months.</p>

<h2>AN AMERICAN JOKE EXPLAINED.</h2>

<p>We don't understand American institutions&#8212;that's a fact. We don't
understand the American Press; which is one of the greatest of those
institutions. Deficient in the sense of irony, we take the playful
abandonment&#8212;the jocose mystification&#8212;of the American newspapers as
simple statement. Hence multitudes of dull worthy people among us will
receive the <i>New York Tribune's</i> account of the reception of the
runaway
convict, <span class="smcap">Mitchell</span>, at New York as a prosaic
and authentic narrative of
that event. Had <span class="smcap">Greenacre</span>, by some chance,
escaped the gallows, they
will be inclined to think, he too would have been hailed with enthusiasm
and acclamation, as an accession to the worth and manhood of American
citizenship. For <span class="smcap">Mitchell</span> resembled the other
 chiefly in the
circumstance of not having been hanged. He was no mere political
non-conformist and unsuccessful opponent of the existing order of
things, vulgarly and technically termed a rebel. He was a traitor in the
vilest sense of the word: a malignant hater of the <span class="smcap">Queen</span>
 and the
country: the sort of traitor that mediæval justice contemplated when it
sentenced the criminal so called to be hanged, drawn, and quartered. He
was a sanguinary cruel caitiff; a dogged miscreant who not only preached
pike massacres, but yelled and raved for sulphuric acid, which he would
have had rascals to squirt into soldiers' eyes. Those, therefore, who
are not up to American drollery will naturally be scandalised by the
seemingly sympathetic description, given by the <i>New York Tribune</i>,
 of
the advent of such a fellow amongst the freest and most enlightened
people on earth. Says our facetious contemporary:&#8212;</p>

<blockquote><p>"As the <i>Prometheus</i> came up the river, she was
boarded by <span class="smcap">Messrs.
Meagher</span> and <span class="smcap">William Mitchell</span>, the
brother of the patriot. The
meeting between these friends in sorrow and persecution was
affecting in the extreme. Tears of joy were shed on both sides."</p></blockquote>

<p>Tears which scalded the cheeks down which they flowed; being
vitriolic.
Without this comment&#8212;which would have spoiled the gravity of the
burlesque&#8212;the <i>Tribune</i> proceeds:</p>

<blockquote><p>"On nearing the wharf, the news of <span class="smcap">Mr.
 Mitchell's</span> arrival spread
like wildfire, and ships and piers were literally swarming with the
immense throng who crowded to give him a freeman's welcome."</p></blockquote>

<p>No doubt this is the naked truth. There are, unfortunately, a great
many
scoundrels and ruffians in New York who have an ardent admiration for a
fellow scoundrel and ruffian. It is unnecessary that a New York journal
should explain that these vagabonds are not Americans. But that
explanation is requisite for our stolid readers, whom we will presently
tell who the wretches really were. An individual of the noble and
generous American nation would as soon think of hugging a rattle-snake
or a copper-head, as of taking to his bosom the venomous and
vitriol-squirting <span class="smcap">Mitchell</span>.</p>

<p>As <span class="smcap">Mr. Mitchell</span> and his companions
proceeded to their
destination&#8212;which, notwithstanding the impulsive nature of American
moral feeling, was not the nearest pump&#8212;he experienced various honours,
which the waggish reporter of his triumph enumerates with whimsical
exaggeration&#8212;particularising "roar of artillery," "dense mass of human
beings," the carriages that bore them, being "followed by the throng,"
his way resembling "the march of a conqueror"&#8212;not by any means such a
march as that of a man who is drummed out of his regiment. His friends,
the funny journalist avers, "were almost ready to take him from the
vehicle, and carry him upon their shoulders," and he was "surrounded by
a large number of the citizen-soldiery and <span class="smcap">Nanchan's</span>
 band." Among these
troops were the "Irish Rifles," whose weapon, of course, is the vitriol
squirt&#8212;the "<span class="smcap">Mitchell</span> Guard," the "<span
class="smcap">Meagher</span> Grenadiers," with "Cabbage
Garden," probably, emblazoned on their colours; and sundry other
regiments and guards, which&#8212;it was superfluous to inform the New
Yorkers&#8212;were ragged and&#8212;black.</p>

<p>Here lies the point of the whole joke. Misled by a parcel of
Uncle-Tom-foolery, we are apt to regard the coloured population of the
States as an oppressed race. They are, indeed, shunned and disliked; but
that is entirely by reason of their incorrigible villainy. They won't
work, but they will squat on an estate, and if compelled to clear off
and make room for industrious whites, they shoot the owner of the
property from behind a hedge. Rescued from starvation consequent on
their unthrift and laziness, they turn and curse the benefactor who
feeds them. Such were they who shouted welcome to <span class="smcap">Mitchell</span>;
 and only
think how secure a people must feel in their republican liberty to
permit a mob of savages to indulge in such a demonstration! This base
and brutal multitude did not contain one American citizen. Their bands
are stated to have played Irish melodies, "Star Spangled Banner,"
"Yankee Doodle," and other national airs. No, no. The ragamuffins hated
the stars as well as the stripes too much; and they no more played
"Yankee Doodle" than <span class="smcap">Mitchell</span> sang "Rule
Britannia." Their music may
have included Irish melodies; but their other national airs were limited
to the class comprising "Lucy Neal" and "Ole Dan Tucker." They were an
assemblage of odious, miserable, ugly, degraded brutes, connecting links
between mankind and the monkey. There was not a single Anglo-Saxon in
the whole lot. In short, they were all&#8212;<span class="smcap">Niggers.</span></p>

<h2>CHARITY FOR CHURCHMEN.</h2>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/240b.png" alt="O" class="cap" width="26%" />

<p class="cap_3">OUR friend the <span class="smcap">Bishop of London</span>
 has published a circular urging his
clergy to exert themselves to recruit the failing finances of the
Society for Promoting the Employment of Additional Curates in Populous
Places. Very good; let all the other bishops issue similar injunctions;
and perhaps they will not forget to point out that a great many
additional curates might be provided for populous places out of the
excess of income enjoyed by pluralists, who are the incumbents of
places, some of which are comparatively uninhabited. Their Lordships
might, by example as well as precept, urge their over-paid clergy to
exert themselves for the required object, by pulling out a large amount
of their superfluous revenues, if they can possibly stand so much
exertion. Perhaps it would be as well to try the effect of this
exhortation on the clergy first, and appeal to the laity, if necessary,
afterwards.</p>

<h4>The Real Reason.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Palmerston</span> has resigned. Speculation
is rife as to the cause. We
are in a position to state confidently, that his retirement is owing
neither to the Eastern question, nor the Reform Bill, but to the despair
of the active Home Secretary at the deluge of letters which he has drawn
down by his offer made at Perth to listen to everybody's grievances, and
consider everybody's suggestions&#8212;an undertaking which he has found
himself so utterly unable to redeem, that he has determined on
withdrawing altogether from the attempt.</p>

<h2>LIFE AND DEATH ASSURANCE.</h2>

<p>Among our Provident Institutions are Life Assurance Societies for
Parents, which are Death Assurance Societies for Children. They are
otherwise called Coffin Clubs. They engage to find the money for the
coffin: the subscriber, father or mother, finds the occupant for it&#8212;by
murder.</p>

<p>The Grand Jury at the Liverpool Assizes has expressed its opinion
that
the temptation thus afforded should be destroyed by law. That might be
done, perhaps, by prohibiting the club from paying anybody on account of
a death but the undertaker. But what need of such clubs at all?</p>

<p>Such clubs are necessary to protect the poor from being ruined by a
heavy expense. But why the heavy expense? When I have shuffled off this
mortal coil&#8212;what does it want, except to be put reverently underground?
Cannot that be done for a very small sum of money? Why is it not done on
reasonable terms? Simply because the mode of doing it is not reasonable.
Its performance is attended with a useless sacrifice of
furniture&#8212;necessitated by the tyranny of custom&#8212;to show what is
falsely termed "proper respect." Proper respect is affectionate
memory&#8212;not furniture.</p>

<p>Should I want "proper respect" to be shown to my leg, if I had the
misfortune to lose it, by having it enclosed in an ornamental box, and
deposited in a subterranean apartment, with a large expenditure in
wages, coach-hire, silk, and crape, and feathers extracted from the tail
of a great bird? If the leg is not to be treated with such "proper
respect," why is the trunk?</p>

<p>The rich show "proper respect" by means of ostrich feathers and such
like. The poor are obliged to follow their lead as far as they can&#8212;and
farther. Hence Coffin Clubs&#8212;whence infanticide.</p>

<p>Superior Classes, every nail that you drive to show "proper respect,"
 is
an incentive to child-murder.</p>

<h4>Originality.</h4>

<p>Originality (says <span class="smcap">Goethe</span>) provokes
originality; and we must say, that at
Billingsgate, and in the House of Commons, the provocation sometimes is
exceedingly strong. The smallest provocation we know of the kind is in
the British drama; in fact so small is it, that we doubt if it amounts
to any provocation at all. We only wish some one would provoke somebody
else to write an original play, by writing one first himself.</p>

<p>A <span class="smcap">Dr. Church</span> has invented some pieces of

success. In these days, when ecclesiastical authority is so greatly at a

<h2>THE HANWELL COOKERY BOOK.</h2>

<p>So much progress has been made in that humane treatment of insane
persons, which allows them to follow their ordinary callings and
pursuits, that nearly all the in-door work of many lunatic asylums is
now performed by the patients.</p>

<p>Thus at Hanwell there are lunatic gardeners who keep their parterres
and
greenhouses in a most rational state of order and neatness, and we have
not heard that the cracked violinist, to whose music his poor companions
are allowed to dance, is in the habit of mixing up "Pop goes the Weasel"
with the Dead March in Saul, or committing any similar instrumental
vagary, as many might expect. Encouraged by the success of the
gardening, washing, ironing, tailoring, and other experiments, the
Directors of this noble establishment have recently attempted to extend
this employment of the insane to the higher branches of household
economy&#8212;including the great mystery of the kitchen.</p>

<p>But insane cookery, to judge of the specimens of the Hanwell <i>cuisine</i>
which are now before us, does not seem likely to turn out so well as the
simpler arts to which the presence of the wits does not appear
absolutely indispensable. It is to be feared that the digestions of the
inmates of the asylum might be seriously impaired by such dishes as the
following:&#8212;</p>

<h4><i>Soufflet à la Bombardino.</i></h4>

<p>Take three-quarters of a pound of Dorking lime, two ounces of the
best
saltpetre, and a coffee-cup full of tin tacks. Beat well together with a
whisk, bake for seven minutes and a quarter; add a few horse-chestnuts,
a handful of cow's hair, and a gill of lemon juice. If the cook be a
dissenter, or have secretly married the butler, the lemon juice may be
omitted.</p>

<h4><i>Apoplectic Jelly.</i></h4>

<p>Take four hundred kangaroo's eggs, and when the water is hot simmer
gently, stirring in dandelion leaves one by one: strain all through a
thin deal board, and set it by in a pint basin to cool. This will keep
for any length of time (if <span class="smcap">Dr. Conolly</span> is not
 allowed to look at it),
and will serve as a vegetable for sick people or young children. If not
sweet enough, add some indigo and a pound of steel-filings.</p>

<h4><i>Oltenitza Pudding.</i></h4>

<p>Take some old Russia duck and shred it in a stew-pan with as much
water
as you can pour in without putting the fire out. When the feathers are
loose pluck them out carefully, and mince with forced meat for garnish.
Put in half a tablespoonful of salt, a bunch of chopped straw, and a
little grated pumice-stone, then add the rice. Sweeten to your taste,
dress with your garnish, and serve in a napkin. A few tea-leaves
sprinkled over, will make it look more inviting. If anybody comes into
the kitchen while the stew-pan is on the fire, put it under the table.</p>

<h4><i>Methuselah Fritters.</i></h4>

<p>Have some castor-oil boiling, slice three large heads of
mangel-wurzel,
and put them in your castor-oil till quite crisp. Try them with your
finger. If done enough they will burn you. Add three oysters, a nutmeg,
a teacupful of brown sugar, and a capsicum. If more flavour is wanted,
you may add a tablespoonful of Bath brick. Serve up hot on a gridiron.
If for a second course, tripe may be substituted for the mangel-wurzel,
but oil of vitriol is preferable.</p>

<h4><i>Croquettes à la Conolly.</i></h4>

<p>Steal a marrow-bone from which the marrow has been taken out, and
burn
it till charred. Then scrape it into a butter-boat, with two spring
onions minced, an oyster-shell, and a quarter of a pound of dry glue.
Put up in shapes, and let it stand till it is mouldy. Have some treacle
cold, and when it boils, dip your croquettes in it one after another,
and serve up in the middle of next week. If made with marine glue they
require more care, but will eat all the crisper. The yolks of two
shop-eggs may be added, but this is a matter of taste, and unless the
eggs are very stale they will give your croquettes too nutty a flavour.
Some roll the croquettes in the ashes, but this is not to be
recommended, unless where there are foreigners at table and a man
servant is kept.</p>

<h2>SERJEANT ADAMS ON A KNOTTY POINT.</h2>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 30%;">
<a href="images/244a.png">
<img src="images/244a.png" alt="Scotsman with umbrella"
width="100%" /></a>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Serjeant Adams</span> occasionally makes
sensible remarks. In the course of
the other day, for instance, alluding to some misrepresentation of his
opinions on the system of flogging, which had got abroad, he is reported
to have said that</p>

<blockquote><p>"He had for years watched the progress of that system,
and had had
ample opportunities of doing so, on account of so many children
tried before him; and he had so frequently found that the
commencement of a child's criminal history was with three days'
imprisonment and a whipping, and after that beginning the child so
constantly came back to this court, that his mind quite revolted
from passing a sentence involving whipping at all."</p></blockquote>

<p>"Give a young thief a whipping, and have done with him," is a very
common prescription of Common Sense for the cure of juvenile
delinquency. Common Sense, however, sometimes jumps to conclusions which
are not verified. Common Sense uttered predictions concerning gas and
steam, which have not come to pass. And the views of Common Sense
concerning discipline for youthful offenders are perhaps rather too
summary. "Give the young thief a whipping"&#8212;very good. The thing is done
with small expenditure of time and material. It does not take many
minutes: it is attended only with a slight wear of whipcord: cost you a
farthing, as <span class="smcap">Mr. Pepys</span> would have said: and a
 certain laceration of
human integument, cost you absolutely nothing. You lose nothing whatever
in raw material. Therefore inflict the whipping on the young thief. And
have done with him? Ah! "If it were done, when 'tis done, then 'twere
well it were done quickly." But it appears that you won't have done with
him. On the contrary, after that beginning, the child constantly comes
back to this court, as <span class="smcap">Assistant-Judge Adams</span>
says. After all, is it not
manifest even to Common Sense&#8212;if Common Sense will exert itself&#8212;that
to attempt the reformation of a child&#8212;and for what else would you
punish a child?&#8212;by whipping him, is really beginning at the wrong end?
The application of the scourge belongs to the operative part&#8212;the
surgery&#8212;of the treatment of criminals; and operations should be
resorted to only when all other remedies have failed. Primarily, the
whip lacerates the skin; but the laceration is succeeded by hardening of
the part that was lacerated; but not only by that: by the induration,
also, of any amount of heart that the patient may previously have been
endowed with. After such a beginning, no wonder that he comes back to
this court or that. No: the lash is a valuable application, so is lunar
caustic, so is lapis infernalis, or the actual cautery itself. But
reserve it for desperate cases. Resort to it only in those of subjects
that have lost all sensibility to every other appeal. Keep stripes for
the ruffian who savagely maltreats his wife; for the hopeless brute, for
the irreclaimable blackguard. And administer them to him in such a dose
that he will not readily come back to any court to have it repeated. But
a little whipping is a dangerous thing. It degrades and brutalises
without subduing. You must lash a human being like a hound if you want
to conquer him as you would conquer a hound&#8212;and it surely would be
rather too severe to carry flagellation to that extent with juvenile
offenders. It is not fair, moreover, to use the rod till you have first
tried the schoolmaster.</p>

<h4>Very Unseasonable Intelligence.</h4>

<p>One of "Our own Correspondents," speaking of the recent disaster at
Sinope, rather startles us with the announcement that</p>

<blockquote><p>"Turkey for the present is unquestionably worsted."</p></blockquote>

<p>If this be literally the fact, we only hope our country friends will
postpone their usual hampers until Turkey is itself again.</p>

<hr />

<h4>SEASONABLE INCONSISTENCE.</h4>

<p>A jovial young printer of our acquaintance having declared the other
evening that he had left off work, was found under the misletoe a little
later most busily employed in printing kisses.</p>

<hr />

<h4>UNEVENHANDED JUSTICE.</h4>

<p>Our old friend, <span class="smcap">Sir Peter Laurie</span>, in his
recent modest letter to the
<i>Times</i> upon the legal (as well indeed as social, moral, and in
universal) worth and excellence of our Aldermen, marks with a special
note of admiration the gratifying fact, that the number of acquittals
from our City Police Courts falls considerably below the usual
percentage. Recollecting <span class="smcap">Sir Peter's</span> old
propensity for "putting down,"
we are in some degree prepared to find that such a fact as this should
be a matter of rejoicing with him. <span class="smcap">Sir Peter</span>
clearly holds that the
proof of the trial is in the finding guilty, and he has, doubtless, but
a low opinion of those judicial courts where mercy is allowed to "season
justice." "The rigour of the law" is clearly no unmeaning phrase in <span
 class="smcap">Sir
Peter Laurie's</span> eyes: indeed, we almost doubt if <i>Judex damnatur
 cum
innocens absolvitur</i> be not in reality his first legal maxim.</p>

<p>Whatever <span class="smcap">Sir Peter's</span> present faults may
be, there is no denying that he
has rid himself of an old one. We cannot certainly accuse him of
tenacity of opinion, when he shows himself so evidently prone to
conviction.</p>

<p>The Sommerophone is a wonderful instrument, and <span class="smcap">Mr.
 Sommer</span> ought to have
the benefit of every publicity for his statement, that a certain defect
remarked in its utterance the other night, during the frost, occurred,
not, as was surmised, from any deficiency of understanding between
himself and it, "but entirely through the severity of the weather,
which," <span class="smcap">Mr. Sommer</span> adds, "as all musicians
well know, has a most
detrimental effect on all brass instruments (particularly such as
mine)." It thus appears that the alleged misunderstanding between <span
class="smcap">Mr.
Sommer</span> and his instrument was a mere coolness on the part of the
latter
only. The notes seem to have been partially frozen in; and if, during
the subsequent thaw, any of them came out again, as in a memorable
instance, perhaps <span class="smcap">Mr. Sommer</span> will state the
circumstance. Possibly, as
the Sommerophone had got a cold, it would have completed its solo later
in the evening in question, if its proprietor had given it a basin of
gruel and put it into hot water before going to bed. We have no doubt of
the truth of that gentleman's assertion as regards most brass
instruments; but he is mistaken in extending it to all. It has not been
observed in the House of Commons that cold weather particularly affects
the tone of the <span class="smcap">Pope's</span> Brass Band.</p>

<p>We knew that vocalists were liable to colds, and other contingencies
of
climate; but this is the first time we ever heard of a musical
instrument being subject to fits of indisposition. If apologies are
henceforth to be accepted for trumpets, ophecleides, and other brazen
instruments, as well as for tenors and sopranos, we shall be constantly
troubled with excuses on behalf of some capricious trombone seized
suddenly with an affection of the windpipe, and, in the trombone, the
pipe through which the wind is conveyed is of a somewhat delicate
texture. The Professor threatens that his next performance shall be
accompanied by a full orchestra; but if it should happen that all the
brazen instruments are suffering from bronchial or any other affection
of their tubes, the result will be far from agreeable.</p>

<h2>CHRISTMAS WAITS EXTRAORDINARY.</h2>

<center>(<i>From our own Reporter.</i>)</center>

<p>There are some remarkable additions to the usual Waits this year,
which
the papers have uniformly neglected to notice. As Corrector-General of
the Press, it devolves on <i>Mr. Punch</i> of course to supply the
omission.
Half a moment's reflection will, he thinks, convince any of his readers
who would be styled "intelligent," that&#8212;</p>

<p>There's the <span class="smcap">Earl of Aberdeen</span> Waiting&#8212;for
the protracted war which will
result most probably from his protracted peace policy.</p>

<p>There are the Rotten Boroughs Waiting&#8212;for the expected Reform Bill
which is to put them in good odour.</p>

<p>There are the Inhabitants of London (and twenty miles about it)
Waiting&#8212;for the extinction of that truly burning shame, the City
Coal-Tax.</p>

<p>There are the Keepers of the Betting-shops Waiting&#8212;to evade the
recent
Act which apparently has shut them up.</p>

<p>There are the Women of England Waiting&#8212;for a law that will
<i>effectually</i> protect them against brutal assaults.</p>

<p>There are the English Tourists Waiting&#8212;for hotels where they may
enter
without being let in.</p>

<p>There's many an English Operative Waiting&#8212;to find that his strike is
in
the end a heavy blow to him.</p>

<p>There's many an English Curate Waiting&#8212;to find that his income will
exceed a London footman's.</p>

<p>There are the Readers at the Museum Waiting&#8212;for the end of the world,
or that of the catalogue.</p>

<p>There's the Corporation of London Waiting&#8212;to be crushed by the
Commission which is now sitting on them.</p>

<p>There's the Emperor of Russia Waiting&#8212;for the spring which will
enable
him to jump into Turkey.</p>

<p>And finally, there's <i>Mr. Punch</i> himself Waiting&#8212;very pleasantly
 on The
Universe with his Twenty-fifth Volume.</p>
